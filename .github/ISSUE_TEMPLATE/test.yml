      label: OBO Foundry Pre-registration Checklist
      description: |
        To be considered for inclusion in the OBO Foundry, an ontology must meet certain requirements, as described in in [the registration process instructions](http://obofoundry.org/docs/Policy_for_OBO_namespace_and_associated_PURL_requests.html) and the [registration review checklist](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/blob/master/docs/RegistrationChecklist.md). To ensure you are aware of some of its key points, please review the checklist below.
      options:
        - label: I have read and understood [the registration process instructions](http://obofoundry.org/docs/Policy_for_OBO_namespace_and_associated_PURL_requests.html) and the [registration checklist](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/blob/master/docs/RegistrationChecklist.md).
          required: true
        - label: There is no other ontology in the OBO Foundry which would be an appropriate place for my terms. If there were, I have contacted the editors, and we decided in mutual agreement that a separate ontology is more appropriate.
          required: false
        - label: My ontology has a specific release file with a version IRI and a `dc:license` annotation, serialised in RDF/XML.
          required: false
        - label: I understand that term definitions, while not mandatory, are key to understanding the intentions of a term especially when the ontology is used in curation. I made sure that a reasonable majority of terms in my ontology have definitions, using the [IAO:0000115](https://ontobee.org/ontology/IAO?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115) property.
          required: false
        - label: For every term in my ontology, I checked whether another OBO Foundry ontology has one with the same meaning. If so, I re-used that term directly (not by cross-reference, by directly using the IRI).
          required: false
        - label: For all relationship properties (Object and Data Property), I checked whether [the Relation Ontology (RO)](https://ontobee.org/ontology/catalog/RO?iri=http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl%23ObjectProperty) includes an appropriate one. I understand that aligning with RO is an essential part of the overall alignment between OBO ontologies!
          required: false
        - label: For the selection of appropriate annotation properties, I looked at [OMO](https://ontobee.org/ontology/catalog/OMO?iri=http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl%23AnnotationProperty) first. I understand that aligning ontology metadata and term-level metadata is essential for cross-integration of OBO ontologies.
          required: false
        - label: If I was not sure about the meaning of any of the checkboxes above, I have consulted with a member of the OBO Foundry for advice, e.g., through the [obo-discuss](https://groups.google.com/g/obo-discuss) Google Group.
          required: false
        - label: The requested ID space does not conflict with another ID space found in other registries such as the Bioregistry and BioPortal, see [here](https://obofoundry.org/id-policy) for a complete list.
          required: false
