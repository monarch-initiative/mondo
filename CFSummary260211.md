# CFTR Variant-Centric Summary: Variants, Diseases, Treatments, and Phenotypes

**Date:** 2026-02-11

## Notes

- **One row per variant per MONDO term.** If a variant is reported in multiple conditions, it appears in multiple rows.
- **Frequency** refers to global allele frequency among CF chromosomes unless otherwise noted.
- **Treatment** refers to approved CFTR-targeted modulator therapy for that variant. Non-CFTR treatments (e.g., insulin for CFRD, surgery for meconium ileus) are noted separately.
- **CFTR2 classification**: CF-causing, VVCC (variant of varying clinical consequence), or non-CF-causing, per the CFTR2 database (2024 update).
- **HGVS nomenclature** is provided alongside legacy names for precision.
