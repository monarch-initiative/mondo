Seizures can be repetitive over hours to days. Seizures remit by 4-6 months of age. A proportion of those affected may have seizures in later life. The child is expected to have normal developmental progress. This is distinguished from familial neonatal epilepsy on the basis of family history. These entities may have similar genetic etiologies, with de novo mutations responsible for the lack of family history in self-limited neonatal seizures.
