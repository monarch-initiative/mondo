MONDO:0968986	chaotic conus spinal cord lipoma	A rare dysraphic spinal cord lipoma characterized by the lipomatous mass extending ventrally to the dorsal root entry zone, indicating a more severe malformation of the spinal cord. The diagnosis can be suggested on imaging but usually confirmed during surgery.		
MONDO:0968987	extramedullary conus spinal cord lipoma	A rare closed lipomatous, dysraphic malformation of the lower spinal cord characterized by extramedullary lipomatous mass attached to the conus region. The conus is dysplastic and poorly delineated. Various morphological subtypes are recognized. Possible symptoms include bowel and bladder dysfunction and neuro-orthopedic deformity of the lower limbs.		
MONDO:0968988	saccular spinal dysraphism with a stalk to the dome	A rare spinal dysraphism characterized by a meningocele, containing a stalk, that is attached to the inner surface of the meningocele. The stalk can be posteriorly fibroneural (saccular limited dorsal myeloschisis) or the spinal cord itself (myelic limited dorsal malformation).		
MONDO:0968989	non-saccular limited dorsal myeloschisis	A rare form of limited dorsal myeloschisis (LDM), characterized by a non saccular cutaneous stigmata (midline skin abnormality classically dimple, pit or sometimes angioma), the stalk is attached to this cutaneous stigmata. Fibroneural stalk varies in thickness and complexity.		
MONDO:1030000	hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia with polycystic kidney disease	Any hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia which is accompanied by cystic structures in the kidneys, and in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the PMM2 promoter.
