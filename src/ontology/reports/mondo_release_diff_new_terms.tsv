MONDO:0100513	TRAF3 haploinsufficiency	Any Mendelian disease in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the TRAF3 gene. TRAF3 haploinsufficiency caused by heterozygous loss of function (null) variants presents as an immune dysregulation syndrome of recurrent bacterial infections, autoimmunity, systemic inflammation, B cell lymphoproliferation, and hypergammaglobulinemia.

MONDO:0100520	NKX2-1 related choreoathetosis and congenital hypothyroidism with or without pulmonary dysfunction	The NKX2-1 gene is located on chromosome 14 at 14q13.3 and encodes the NK2 homeobox 1 protein, a transcription factor that binds and activates thyroid specific genes. NKX2-1 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant NKX2-1 related choreoathetosis and congenital hypothyroidism with or without pulmonary dysfunction in 1998.		
MONDO:0100521	NOG-related symphalangism spectrum disorder	An autosomal dominant condition caused by pathogenic variants of the NOG gene, encoding the noggin protein. Five overlapping clinical syndromes associated with NOG mutations have been described; proximal symphalangism, multiple synostoses syndrome 1, tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome, stapes ankylosis with broad thumbs and toes, and brachydactyly type B2. NOG-related symphalangism spectrum disorder is a new term initially proposed by Potti et al., 2011 to encompass these disorders. NOG-SSD is characterized by proximal symphalangism, conductive deafness caused by stapes ankylosis, ocular abnormality such as hyperopia and strabismus, and characteristic facial features including a broad, tubular-shaped nose and a thin upper vermilion.

MONDO:0100523	SPAST-related motor disorder	Heterozygous variants in SPAST have been reported in relation to pure spastic paraplegias (infantile, ascending), complicated or complex spastic paraplegia (with dementia, cerebellar ataxia, epilepsy, and/or peripheral neuropathy) and cerebral palsy. Age of symptom onset ranges from neonatal to advanced age with varying symptom severity,
