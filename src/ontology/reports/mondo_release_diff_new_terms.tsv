MONDO:0859747	grade I lymphomatoid granulomatosis	A lymphomatoid granulomatosis that is characterized by the presence of a polymorphous lymphoid infiltrate without cytologic atypia. Large lymphocytes are absent or rare. By in situ hybridization, EBV-positive cells are infrequently seen.		
MONDO:0859748	grade II lymphomatoid granulomatosis	A lymphomatoid granulomatosis that is characterized by the presence of occasional large lymphoid cells or immunoblasts in a polymorphous background. Necrosis is more commonly seen as compared to grade I lymphomatoid granulomatosis. By in situ hybridization, EBV-positive cells are readily seen.		
MONDO:0859749	grade III lymphomatoid granulomatosis	A lymphomatoid granulomatosis that is characterized by the presence of aggregates of neoplastic large B-lymphocytes, usually admixed with pleomorphic and Hodgkin-like cells, in a background of chronic inflammation. Necrotic changes are present and are usually extensive.
