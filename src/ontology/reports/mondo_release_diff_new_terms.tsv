MONDO:0700335	familial isolated dilated cardiomyopathy	A rare familial cardiomyopathy characterized by the dilation of left ventricle and progressively impairing of systolic ventricular function, in the absence of abnormal loading conditions or coronary artery disease sufficient to cause global systolic impairment. The disease may cause heart failure or arrhythmia. The disease is isolated when no additional atypical cardiac or extracardiac manifestations are present.		
MONDO:0800487	variable-age onset idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndrome	Any idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndrome that has a variable-age onset.		
MONDO:0800488	neonatal/infantile-onset self-limited epilepsy syndrome	An epilepsy syndrome characterized by the onset of seizures in neonates/infants where there is a high likelihood of spontaneously remitting at a predictable age.		
MONDO:0800489	genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus spectrum	A neonatal/infantile-onset self-limited familial syndrome characterized by the presence of febrile seizures in an individual with a family history of seizures/epilepsy. Febrile seizures may be typical febrile seizures or 'febrile seizures plus' (FS+) may occur, where febrile seizures continue past 6 years of age and/or are accompanied by afebrile seizures which may be generalized or focal. FS+ and GEFS+ are distinguished on the basis of family history. A number of dominantly inherited genes have been linked to both GEFS+ and FS+, with implications for specific genetic counselling, due to the variable severity of the epilepsy in different family members. Although febrile seizures are the hallmark of this familial syndrome, not all individuals in a family may have these.		
MONDO:0800490	neonatal/infantile-onset epilepsy syndrome with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy	A neonatal/infantile epilepsy syndrome characterized by the onset of non-self-limiting seizures and developmental regression or delay in infants/neonates.

Affected individuals have focal aware seizures with mesial temporal lobe features, especially prominent déjà vu. Most patients have a normal MRI, and seizures respond to treatment. A subgroup is recognised that have antecedent febrile seizures, hippocampal atrophy, and drug resistant seizures. Direct questioning of relatives may be required to identify this familial epilepsy syndrome, as many individuals consider their déjà vu experiences as mild and they may not have been diagnosed as seizures.		
MONDO:0800494	variable-age onset combined generalized and focal epilepsy syndrome	An epilepsy syndrome characterized by a combined generalized and focal epilepsy syndromes where age at seizure onset varies.		
MONDO:0800495	variable-age epilepsy syndrome with developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathy or progressive neurological deterioration	An epilepsy syndrome characterized by seizures along with developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathy or progressive neurological deterioration where age at seizure onset varies.

Seizures often produce such mild symptoms that they are not diagnosed. There are no implications expected for development or learning and seizures are typically infrequent and well controlled. EAF may occur as a familial syndrome, familial EAF (FEAF, previous known as autosomal dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy or autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features). Inheritance may be autosomal dominant (ADEAF), with incomplete penetrance.		
MONDO:0800498	childhood-onset genetic generalized epilepsy syndrome	A genetic generalized epilepsy that has an onset during childhood.		
MONDO:0800499	childhood-onset idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndrome	An idiopathic generalized epilepsy that has an onset during childhood.		
MONDO:0800500	childhood-onset epilepsy syndrome with developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathy	A childhood-onset epilepsy syndrome where the onset of the condition includes manifestations of cognitive, neurological, or psychiatric impairment, stagnation, or regression, due directly to the underlying etiology. In contrast, an epileptic encephalopathy (EE) is present when the encephalopathy is caused by the epileptic activity. The term developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) is used when both factors contribute to the patient’s condition.		
MONDO:0800501	developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathy with spike-wave activation in sleep	A spectrum of conditions with varied degree of cognitive, language, behavioral, and motor regression associated with marked spike-wave activation in sleep. The regression is seen within weeks of the EEG pattern. This syndrome encompasses the previous syndromes epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-wave in sleep and atypical childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (also previously known as pseudo-Lennox syndrome and atypical benign partial epilepsy). Landau–Kleffner syndrome is a specific subtype of EE-SWAS, where regression affects mainly language, with an acquired auditory agnosia.		
MONDO:0800502	childhood-onset self-limited focal epilepsy syndrome	A group of conditions characterized by age-dependent occurrence in otherwise normal children. Cognition and neurological evaluation are typically normal. Remission occurs in almost all patients by puberty. Presumed genetic factors have an important role. Seizure semiology and electroencephalographic (EEG) features are specific for each of the syndromes included in this group.		
MONDO:0800503	TMEM63B-related developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with anemia	A developmental and epileptic encephalopathy caused by variation in the TMEM63B gene. This disorder is characterised by early-onset drug-resistant epilepsy, with moderate-to-profound intellectual disability, severe motor impairment and brain structural anomalies.

MONDO:1010098	TFAP2B-related congenital heart disease spectrum disorder	Any congenital heart disease caused by pathogenic variation(s) in the TFAP2B gene, which encodes the transcription factor AP-2β. This disorder is characterized by patent ductus arteriosus, facial dysmorphism and hand anomalies. Additional features include sensorineural hearing loss, scoliosis, dental anomalies, and central diabetes insipidus. Given the spectrum of symptoms associated with this condition, patients may exhibit a combination of these features. The underlying mechanism of the spectrum disorder is both dominant negative and loss-of-function. Pathogenic missense variants reported in Char syndrome patients appear to be dominant negative while loss-of-function alleles in PDA patients are likely to act through haploinsufficiency.
