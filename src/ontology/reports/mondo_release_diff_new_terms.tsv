MONDO:0100613	BMP4-related ocular growth disorder	Any ocular growth disorder in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the BMP4 gene.		
MONDO:0100632	CSF1R-related disorder	Any disease in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the CSF1R gene.		
MONDO:0700345	TMEM127-related tumor predisposition	An autosomal dominant tumor predisposition disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the TMEM127 gene, characterized by an increased risk of paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma, as well as an increased risk of renal cell carcinoma.		
MONDO:0700346	MAX-related tumor predisposition	An autosomal dominant tumor predisposition disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the MAX gene, characterized by an increased risk of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma.		
MONDO:0700347	SDHC-related Mitochondrial Disease	Mitochondrial complex II deficiency due to pathogenic variants in the SDHC gene, resulting in a variety of clinical manifestations, including neurological and muscular symptoms.		
MONDO:0700348	BMPR1A-related juvenile polyposis syndrome	An autosomal dominant disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the BMPR1A gene characterized by gastrointestinal juvenile polyps and a predisposition to gastrointestinal cancer.		
MONDO:1010151	gallbladder disease 4	An inherited susceptibility or predisposition to developing hereditary gallbladder disease in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the ABCG8 gene.		
MONDO:1010152	autosomal dominant nebulin-related myopathy	Any myopathy in which an autosomal dominantly inherited genetic variation in the NEB gene causes disease via a dominant-negative mechanism. Symptoms reported in patients include distal muscle weakness, hypotonia, muscle fiber atrophy, foot drop, high arched palate, feeding difficulties, and type 1 fiber predominance.		
MONDO:1010154	adult hypophosphatasia	Adult hypophosphatasia (A-HPP) is a mildform of hypophosphatasia characterized by osteomalacia, chondrocalcinosis, osteoarthropathy, stress fractures duringmiddle age, and dental anomalies.		
MONDO:1010168	childhood hypophosphatasia	Childhood-onset hypophosphatasia is a rare, mildform of hypophosphatasia characterized by onset after six months of age and widely variable clinical features from low bone mineral density for age, to unexplained fractures,skeletal deformities,and rickets with short stature and waddling gait.		
MONDO:1010169	infantile hypophosphatasia	Infantile hypophosphatasia (I-HPP) is a very rare, severe form of hypophosphatasia characterized by infantile rickets without elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and a wide range of clinical manifestations due to hypomineralization.		
MONDO:1040039	OFD1-related ciliopathy	Any ciliopathy caused by monoallelic, biallelic, or hemizygous variants in the OFD1 gene.		
MONDO:1060123	GRIN1-related neurodevelopmental disorder	A neurodevelopmental disorder caused by variation in the GRIN1 gene. It is characterized by mild-to-profound developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID) in all affected individuals. Other common manifestations are epilepsy, muscular hypotonia, movement disorders, spasticity, feeding difficulties, and behavior issues. A subset of individuals show a malformation of cortical development consisting of extensive and diffuse bilateral polymicrogyria.		
MONDO:1060126	exogenous Cushing syndrome	A form of Cushing syndrome caused by prolonged exposure or excessive use of cortisteroids, usually from medications taken to treat other conditions.		
MONDO:1060132	ARHGAP29-related non-syndromic orofacial cleft	Any orofacial cleft in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the ARHGAP29 gene.		
MONDO:1060134	atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease	Any cardiovascular disease resulting from atherosclerosis.		
MONDO:1060136	PIK3R1-related immunodeficiency and SHORT syndrome	A group of disorders caused by a variation in PIK3R1 gene that produces a structurally altered but present p85Î± protein, disrupting PI3K signaling and leading to features such as immune deficiency, autoimmunity, short stature, and distinct facial and skeletal features.		
MONDO:1060138	GRIN disorder	A group of neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders caused by pathogenic variants in genes encoding subunits of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, including GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, and GRIN2D. These disorders are associated with a spectrum of symptoms such as developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, movement disorders, speech and language impairment, and neuropsychiatric features. The clinical presentation and severity vary depending on the specific gene and mutation involved.		
MONDO:1060139	GRIN2A-related disorder	A group of neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders caused by variants in the GRIN2A gene, characterized by a broad spectrum of symptoms including developmental delay or intellectual disability, epilepsy, speech and language impairments, movement disorders, and neuropsychiatric features.		
MONDO:1060140	GRIN2A-related developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathy with spike-wave activation in sleep	Any developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathy with spike-wave activation in sleep in which the cause of the disease is a variation in GRIN2A gene.		
MONDO:1060141	GRIN2A-related rolandic epilepsy-speech dyspraxia syndrome	Any rolandic epilepsy-speech dyspraxia syndrome in which the cause of the disease is a variation in GRIN2A gene.		
MONDO:1060142	GRIN2A-related self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes	Any self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes in which the cause of the disease is a variation in GRIN2A gene.		
MONDO:7770001	equine juvenile spinocerebellar ataxia, FDXR-related, horse	Any spinocerebellar ataxia that occurs in horses due to a variation in the FDXR gene. EJSCA is a degenerative axonopathy characterized by acute onset of ataxia within the first month of life, affecting the pelvic limbs more severely than the thoracic limb and rapidly progressing to inability to stand.
