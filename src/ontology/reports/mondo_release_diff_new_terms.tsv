MONDO:0100498	UROD-related inherited porphyria	Any inherited porphyria in which the cause of the disease is monoallelic or biallelic variants in the UROD gene.		
MONDO:0100502	NTHL1-deficiency tumor predisposition syndrome	Biallelic constitutional/germline loss-of-function NTHL1 variants confer predisposition to tumor formation demonstrating ‘COSMIC Signature 30’ mutation profile. Tumors have been reported at multiple primary sites; in particular adenomatous polyposis of colon (~10-50 polyps), colorectal cancer, and breast cancer.		
MONDO:0100503	DPH5-related diphthamide-deficiency syndrome	A neurodevelopmental disorder in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the DPH5 gene, which is characterized by craniofacial dysmorphology, profound neurodevelopmental delay, multisystem abnormalities, and miscarriages.		
MONDO:0100504	fungal infection of the toenail	A fungal infectious disease that involves the toenail.		
MONDO:0100505	food dermatitis	Dermatitis caused by an allergic reaction to ingested food.		
MONDO:0100506	Cockayne spectrum with or without cerebrooculofacioskeletal syndrome	An autosomal recessive, multisystem condition caused by pathogenic variants of the ERCC6 gene, encoding the DNA excision repair protein, ERCC-6. Cockayne spectrum with or without cerebrooculofacioskeletal syndrome is characterized by growth failure at birth, with little or no postnatal neurologic development in addition to congenital cataracts or other structural anomalies of the eye, early postnatal contractures of the spine (kyphosis, scoliosis) and joints, and death usually occurring by age five years. This term lumps Cockayne syndrome type 2/B (CSB), cerebrooculofacioskeletal syndrome 1 (COFS syndrome), and De Sanctis-Cacchione syndrome into a spectrum of disease.		
MONDO:0700082	Robertsonian translocation Down syndrome	Chromosomal disorder in which (part or full) chromosome 21 is attached to another chromosome, resulting in the presence of a third copy of part of full chromosome 21 genetic material. A Robertsonian translocation is a structural chromosomal anomaly in which two acrocentric chromosomes break, resulting in the fusion of the nonhomologous chromosomes’ long arms to form a single, large chromosome.		
MONDO:0700083	reciprocal translocation down syndrome	Chromosomal disorder in which (part or full) chromosome 21 has been exchange with another chromosome, resulting in the presence of a third copy of (part or full) chromosome 21 genetic material. A reciprocal translocation is a chromosome abnormality caused by exchange of parts between non-homologous chromosomes.		
MONDO:0700093	balanced Robertsonian translocation Down syndrome	Robertsonian translocation Down syndrome in which translocation displacement of the end regions of chromosomes occured without loss of chromosomal material between the two nonhomologous chromosomes.		
MONDO:0700094	unbalanced Robertsonian translocation Down syndrome	Robertsonian translocation Down syndrome in which translocation displacement of the end regions of chromosomes occured with loss of chromosomal material between the two nonhomologous chromosomes.		
MONDO:0800046	thyroid hormone metabolism, abnormal 1	A rare, genetic congenital hypothyroidism disorder characterized by mild global developmental delay in childhood, short stature, delayed bone age, and abnormal thyroid and selenium levels in serum (high total and free T4 concentrations, low T3, high reverse T3, normal to high TSH, decreased selenium). Intellectual disability, primary infertility, hypotonia, muscle weakness, and impaired hearing have also been reported.		
MONDO:0800047	macrothrombocytopenia, isolated, 1, autosomal dominant	Any autosomal dominant macrothrombocytopenia in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the TUBB1 gene.		
MONDO:0800104	immunodeficiency 105	Any immunodeficiency disease which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the PTPRC gene.		
MONDO:0800105	catatonia	A psychiatric disorder featuring stupor, posturing, and echophenomena.		
MONDO:0800106	disruptive behavior disorder	A mental disorder that includes conduct disorder (CD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Features may include frequent aggression, deceitfulness, and defiance, and often persist through the lifespan.
