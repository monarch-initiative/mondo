MONDO:1010182	premenstrual dysphoric disorder	A severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) that involves significant emotional and physical symptoms in the week or two before a period.		
MONDO:1010183	macular telangiectasia type 2	A macular telangiectasia that causes slow deterioration of central vision, typically appearing in people between the ages of 50 and 60. It is characterized by the dilation and leakage of blood vessels in the macula, the part of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed vision, and is also linked to neurodegeneration in retinal cells.		
MONDO:1010184	macular telangiectasia	An eye disorder characterized by retinal capillary network incompetence, dilatations, and thinning which can be uniocular or binocular and causes gradual deterioration of central vision.		
MONDO:1010185	transplant rejection	A disease related to transplantation that occurs when transplant tissue is rejected by the recipient's immune system, which destroys the transplanted tissue.		
MONDO:1010186	hyperacute transplant rejection	A transplant rejection that appears in the first minutes following transplantation and occurs only in vascularized grafts. This very fast rejection is characterized by vessels thrombosis leading to graft necrosis. Hyperacute rejection is caused by the presence of antidonor antibodies existing in the recipient before transplantation. These antibodies induce both complement activation and stimulation of endothelial cells to secrete Von Willebrand procoagulant factor, resulting in platelet adhesion and aggregation. The result of these series of reactions is the generation of intravascular thrombosis leading to lesion formation and ultimately to graft loss.		
MONDO:1010187	acute transplant rejection	A transplant rejection that is caused by an immune response directed against the graft and occurs between 1 week and several months after transplantation. Acute rejection is diagnosed on histological analysis of a graft biopsy. Acute rejection is thought to result from two immunological mechanisms that may act alone or in combination: (1) a T-cell-dependent process that corresponds to acute cellular rejection, and (2) a B-cell-dependent process that generates the acute humoral rejection.		
MONDO:1010188	chronic transplant rejection	An insidious form of transplant rejection that leads to graft destruction over months to years after tissue transplantation. Chronic rejection can be mediated by either humoral or cellular mechanisms linked to memory/plasma cells and antibodies. The presence of tertiary lymphoid organs in the graft is a characteristic of this form of rejection.		
MONDO:1060190	APP-related brain and vascular amyloidosis	A hereditary amyloidosis characterized by a spectrum of neurodegenerative and neurovascular phenotypes caused by pathogenic variant in the APP gene, resulting in an abnormal clearance of amyloid peptides, either by overproduction and decreased clearance of amyloid peptides, with deposition of amyloid in plaques and blood vessel walls. Affected individuals may present with progressive cognitive decline, cerebral vascular amyloidosis with white matter changes, and stroke with or without hemorrhage.		
MONDO:1060191	ciliopathy-IFT74	Any ciliopathy caused by variants in the IFT74 gene.		
MONDO:1060194	FAS-related autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome	An autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome that results from defective lymphocyte homoestasis, and is caused by variants in the FAS gene. It is characterized by non-malignant lymphoproliferation, autoimmune disease, and lifelong increased risk for both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.		
MONDO:1060195	SH2B3-related immune system disorder	A predisposition caused by a mutation in SH2B3 gene that presents with myeloproliferation and/or multi-organ autoimmunity.
