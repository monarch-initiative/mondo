MONDO:0035238	vegetative pyoderma gangrenosum	A rare subtype of pyoderma gangrenosum disease characterized by a solitary, erythematous, ulcerated plaque, which lacks the violaceous border typically present in classic pyoderma gangrenosum, usually affecting individuals who are otherwise healthy. Histologically, the lesion presents a central layer containing neutrophilic inflamation, surrounded by a palisade of histiocytes, which are rimmed by a lymphocytic infiltrate. In comparison with the other variants of pyoderma gangrenosum, this subtype usually shows a good response to less aggressive treatments and underlying systemic disorders are less frequently associated. It is considered the most benign and uncommon clinical variant of pyoderma gangrenosum.		
MONDO:0035249	obsolete anomalous aortic origin of the left coronary artery	OBSOLETE. A rare coronary artery congenital malformation characterized by an anomalous origin and course of the left coronary artery, which originates from the right aortic sinus of Valsalva and has an abnormal proximal course, which may be intramural, prepulmonic, subpulmonic, retroaortic, retrocardiac or wrapped around the apex. Patients are frequently asymptomatic, although chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, dizziness, syncope, and sudden cardiac arrest/death (typically following intense physical exertion) may be observed. This malformation is associated with a high risk of sudden cardiac death so surgical revascularization is recommended even in cases with no associated evidence of myocardial ischemia. [Orphanet:541443]	True	
MONDO:0035250	obsolete anomalous aortic origin of the right coronary artery	OBSOLETE. A rare coronary artery congenital malformation characterized by an anomalous origin and course of the right coronary artery, which originates from the left aortic sinus of Valsalva and has an abnormal proximal course, which may be intramural, prepulmonic, subpulmonic, retroaortic, retrocardiac or wrapped around the apex. Patients are frequently asymptomatic, although chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, dizziness, syncope, and sudden cardiac arrest/death (typically following intense physical exertion) may be observed. This malformation is associated with a lower risk of sudden cardiac death therefore surgical revascularization is recommended only when signs and/or symptoms of ischemia are present. [Orphanet:541454]	True	
MONDO:0035251	obsolete anomalous aortic origin of coronary artery	OBSOLETE. A rare group of coronary artery congenital malformation disorders characterized by an anomalous origin and course of the left or right coronary artery, which originates from the contralateral aortic sinus of Valsalva and has an anomalous trajectory which may be: pre-pulmonary (with no hemodynamic consequences), retroaortic (with a course posterior to the aortic root and no hemodynamic consequences), interarterial (located between the aorta and the pulmonary artery and associated with a poorer prognosis), subpulmonary (with an intraconal or intraseptal course), or retrocardiac (located in the posterior atrioventricular sulcus). Clinical manifestations depend on the specific anomalous origin and course which is present, with patients being frequently asymptomatic, although nonspecific chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, dyspnea or syncope, usually following physical exertion, may be associated. Sudden death, due to compression/occlusion of the coronary artery and usually associated with, or immediately following, vigorous physical exercise, may be occasionally observed.

MONDO:0700054	microcephaly 6 with or without short stature	Disorder of fetal brain growth; individuals have small brains and almost always have mental retardation, although rare individuals with mild microcephaly (-3 SD) and normal intelligence have been reported. Clinical features include the features of ‘microcephaly 6, primary, autosomal recessive’ and 'Seckel syndrome', and may include short stature or mild seizures.		
MONDO:0700055	KIF1A related neurological disorder	KIF1A-associated neurological disorder (KAND) encompasses a group of rare neurodegenerative conditions caused by variants in KIF1A		
MONDO:0800025	Teebi hypertelorism syndrome 1	A rare genetic disease characterized by hypertelorism with facial features that can closely resemble craniofrontonasal dysplasia, such as prominent forehead, widow's peak, heavy and broad eyebrows, long palpebral fissures, ptosis, high and broad nasal bridge, short nose, low-set ears, natal teeth, thin upper lip and a grooved chin, as well as limb (i.e. fifth-finger clinodactyly, pes adductus, mild interdigital webbing), urogenital (i.e. bilateral cryptorchidism and shawl scrotum in males) and umbilical (i.e. hernia/small omphalocele) anomalies and cardiac (i.e. ventricular or atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus) defects. Additional findings such as polycystic kidneys and iridochorioretinal colobomas have also been reported and psychomotor development is normal. The facial features can also resemble Aarskog and Opitz G/BBB syndromes.		
MONDO:0800026	central hypoventilation syndrome, congenital, 1, with or without Hirschsprung disease	A rare disease due to a severely impaired central autonomic control of breathing and dysfunction of the autonomous nervous system. The incidence is estimated to be at 1 of 200 000 livebirths. A heterozygous mutation of PHOX-2B gene is found in 90% of the patients. Association with a Hirschsprung's disease is observed in 16% of the cases. Despite a high mortality rate and a lifelong dependence to mechanical ventilation, the long-term outcome of CCHS should be ultimately improved by multidisciplinary and coordinated follow-up of the patients.		
MONDO:0800027	leukoencephalopathy, diffuse hereditary, with spheroids 1	A rare autosomal dominant disease characterized by a complex phenotype including progressive dementia, apraxia, apathy, impaired balance, parkinsonism, spasticity and epilepsy.		
MONDO:0800028	dyskinesia with orofacial involvement, autosomal dominant	A rare paroxysmal movement disorder, with childhood or adolescent onset, characterized by paroxysmal choreiform, dystonic, and myoclonic movements involving the limbs (mostly distal upper limbs), neck and/or face, which can progressively increase in both frequency and severity until they become nearly constant. Patients may also present with delayed motor milestones, perioral and periorbital dyskinesias, dysarthria, hypotonia, and weakness.		
MONDO:0800029	interstitial lung disease 2	A nonneoplastic pulmonary disease that is characterized by the formation of scar tissue within the lungs in the absence of any known cause.		
MONDO:0800030	gastrointestinal defects and immunodeficiency syndrome 1	A rare genetic disease characterized by multiple intestinal atresia in association with combined immunodeficiency and inflammatory bowel disease. Clinical features include widespread atresia extending from the stomach to the rectum, homogenous calcifications in the abdominal cavity, hepatic cholestasis, cirrhosis, and chronic liver failure, hypoplastic thymus, and increased susceptibility to mainly bacteria and viruses. The immunological phenotype consists of profound generalized T-cell lymphopenia and milder natural killer cell and B-cell lymphopenia, as well as low serum levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM, with elevated serum IgE. The disease is mostly fatal in infancy or childhood.
