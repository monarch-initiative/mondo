MONDO:0100478	brain malformations with or without urinary tract defects	A brain disorder caused by pathogenic variants in NFIA that is characterized by developmental delay, corpus callosum agenesis/hypoplasia and craniofacial dysmorphism, such as macrocephaly (caused by hydrocephalus or ventriculomegaly), low-set ears, anteverted nostrils and micrognathia. Urinary tract defects (e.g. vesicoureteral reflux, urinary incontinence) are also frequently associated. Other reported variable manifestations include hypotonia, tethered spinal cord, Chiari type I malformation and seizures.		
MONDO:0100500	Mendelian neurodevelopmental disorder	A neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by genetic modifications where those modifications are inherited from a parent's genome.

MONDO:0800103	COACH syndrome 1	Any COACH syndrome in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the TMEM67 gene.		
MONDO:0800134	primary immunodeficiency due to calcium channel deficiency	An immunodeficiency disease caused by a variation in the CRACR2A gene.		
MONDO:0800135	congenital emphysematous lung disease due to Filamin A loss-of-function variant	Any interstitial lung disease specific to childhood caused by a loss-of-function variation in the FLNA gene. Female children are reported more often. Rare male patients with loss-of-function FLNA mutation-associated lung disease with residual protein function can survive into infancy with a severe form of the phenotype.		
MONDO:0800136	non-severe combined immunodeficiency due to COPG1 deficiency	Any non-severe combined immunodeficiency caused by a deficiency in the COPG1 gene.		
MONDO:0800137	early-onset pulmonary and cutaneous vasculitis	A monogenic autoinflammatory disorder caused by a de novo activating mutation, p.Tyr515∗, in hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK). The disease is characterized by cutaneous vasculitis and chronic pulmonary inflammation that progresses to fibrosis.		
MONDO:0800138	multisystem autoimmune disease due to IKAROS gain of function	An autoimmune disease caused by a loss-of-function variation in the IKZF1/IKAROSgene. Leukocytes of patients exhibited specific defects including impaired IL-2 production by T cells, T helper (TH) skewing toward TH2, low numbers of regulatory T cells (Treg), eosinophilia, and abnormal PC proliferation.		
MONDO:0800139	HELIOS deficiency	A non-severe combined immunodeficiency caused by a loss-of-function variation in the IKZF2 gene that is characterized by recurrent upper respiratory infections, thrush and mucosal ulcers, and chronic lymphadenopathy.		
MONDO:0800140	ITPKB deficiency	Any non-severe combined immunodeficiency in which the cause of the disease is variation in the ITPKB gene.		
MONDO:0800141	MAN2B2 deficiency	Any non-severe combined immunodeficiency in which the cause of the disease is variation in the MAN2B2 gene.		
MONDO:0800142	chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and connective tissue disease due to JNK1 haploinsufficiency	An immunodeficiency disease caused by a variation in MAPK8, the gene encoding c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), that is characterized by chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and a connective tissue disorder that clinically overlaps with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS).		
MONDO:0800143	cytomegalovirus pneumonia due to NOS2 deficiency	Cytomegalovirus pneumonia due to variant in the NOS2 gene.		
MONDO:0800144	autoimmune pulmonary disease due to PD-1 deficiency	An autoimmune disease that is characterized by a lack of PD-1 on patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and reduced IFN production in response to mycobacterial stimuli.		
MONDO:0800145	non-severe combined immunodeficiency due to polymerase delta deficiency	Any non-severe combined immunodeficiency in which the cause of the disease is variation in the POLD1/POLD2 gene.		
MONDO:0800146	agammaglobulinemia, autosomal recessive, due to BOB1 deficiency	Any agammaglobulinemia in which the cause of the disease is autosomal recessive deficiency in the BOB1 gene.		
MONDO:0800147	hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis due to RhoG deficiency	Any genetic hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in which the cause of the disease is an autosomal recessive variation in the RHOG gene.		
MONDO:0800148	autoinflammatory syndrome due to TBK1 deficiency	Any autoinflammatory syndrome in which the cause of the disease is an autosomal recessive variation in the TBK1 gene.		
MONDO:0800149	immunodeficiency, common variable, due to APRIL deficiency	Any commonn variable immunodeficiency in which the cause of the disease is an autosomal recessive variation in the TNFS13 gene.		
MONDO:0810000	choroidal neovascularization	An eye disorder described by the growth of new blood vessels that originate from the choroid through a break in the Bruch membrane into the sub–retinal pigment epithelium (sub-RPE) or subretinal space. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a major cause of visual loss.
