MONDO:0100485	KCNH1 associated disorder	Any neurodevelopmental disorder in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the KCNH1 gene. Variants in KCNH1 cause significant neurodevelopmental disabilities that lie along a phenotypic spectrum ranging from non-syndromic to syndromic. The most common phenotypes associated with variants in KCNH1 include intellectual disability, seizures, hypotonia, absence or hypoplasia of nails, and gingival enlargement. Hypoplastic terminal phalanges of fingers and toes, proximal placement and long thumb, and long toes present less frequently.		
MONDO:0100486	adult acne	Acne that occurs in an adult.		
MONDO:0100487	TPM4-related platelet disorder	A platelet disorder in which the cause of the disease is a variant in the TPM4 gene.		
MONDO:0100488	CDH1-related diffuse gastric and lobular breast cancer	Germline pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in the CDH1 gene predispose to hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, a cancer susceptibility syndrome inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, initially characterized by the increased risk for diffuse gastric cancer (DGC) but subsequently well documented to be associated with lobular breast cancer (LBC) in women.

MONDO:0100490	breasts and/or nipples, aplasia or hypoplasia of, 1			
MONDO:0100491	generalized pustular psoriasis	A rare and extreme form of psoriasis characterized by the appearance of sterile pustules which can take many patterns. All the main pathological features of the disease are accentuated. Generalized pustular psoriasis is clinically heterogeneous in its age at onset, precipitants, severity, and natural history. Many overlapping clinical entities are recognized. There is a relationship between these entities and plaque psoriasis, as some individuals may have episodes of plaque psoriasis preceding or following the generalized pustular psoriasis, but in others generalized pustular psoriasis occurs as the sole phenotype without plaque psoriasis at any time.		
MONDO:0700038	TDP-43 proteinopathy	Disease characterized by the presence of abnormally phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and cleaved DNA-binding protein TDP-43 in affected brain and spinal cord. Inclusions of the pathologic protein in neurons and glia, without the presence of AMYLOID, is the major feature of these conditions, thus making these proteinopathies distinct from most other neurogenerative disorders in which protein misfolding leads to brain amyloidosis. Both frontotemporal lobar degeneration and AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS exhibit this common method of pathogenesis and thus they may represent two extremes of a continuous clinicopathological spectrum of one disease.		
MONDO:0700039	bladder exstrophy-epispadias-cloacal extrophy complex	An anterior midline defect with variable expression involving the infraumbilical abdominal wall including the pelvis, urinary tract, and external genitalia.		
MONDO:0700040	neonatal jaundice due to ABO incompatibility	Jaundice that appears during the neonatal period due to high levels of unconjugated bilirubin that are a result of maternal-fetal ABO incompatibility.		
MONDO:0700041	neuroblastoma, susceptibility to, 2			
MONDO:0700043	syndrome caused by partial chromosomal duplication of the short arm of chromosome 9			
MONDO:8000023	type 3 autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome	A rare, primary immunodeficiency. It is caused by a currently undetermined defect in the Fas-induced apoptosis pathway. No mutations in Fas, FASLG or CASP10 are detectable. Disruption of Fas-induced apoptosis impairs lymphocyte homeostasis and immune tolerance. Characteristic laboratory findings include an increase in circulating, double-negative (CD4-/CD8-) T cells in the setting of immune-mediated anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Clinical signs present in childhood include fatigue, pallor, bruising, hepatosplenomegaly and chronic, non-malignant, non-infectious lymphadenopathy. The clinical course is influenced by a strong association with other autoimmune disorders and an increased risk for developing Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.		
MONDO:8000024	autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, type III caused by mutation in PRKCD	Any autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the PRKCD gene.
