MONDO:0100611	autism spectrum disorder 2	A moderate form of autism spectrum disorder marked by more significant challenges in social communication and more noticeable restricted, repetitive behaviors, requiring substantial support for daily functioning.		
MONDO:0100612	autism spectrum disorder 3	The most severe form of autism spectrum disorder, characterized by severe impairments in social communication and extreme restricted, repetitive behaviors, requiring very substantial support for daily functioning.		
MONDO:0100620	developmental and epileptic encephalopathy	An epilepsy associated with developmental impairment that may be due to either the underlying etiology or the superimposed epileptic activity, or both.		
MONDO:0100621	acquired developmental and epileptic encephalopathy	An instance of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy that is acquired during the lifetime of the individual.		
MONDO:0100623	meningitis-retention syndrome	A neuro-urological condition characterized by aseptic meningitis, typically without any clear causative agent, associated with acute urinary retention. The typical symptoms and neurological signs of aseptic meningitis are usually mild or absent, so the predominant symptom often turns out to be isolated acute urinary retention. Although several cases are reported in the literature, MRS actual prevalence is underestimated. These factors make an early diagnosis of MRS difficult.		
MONDO:0100624	DCTN1-related neurodegeneration	Any neurodegenerative disorder in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the DCTN1 gene.		
MONDO:0100625	childhood-onset dementia	Dementia beginning in childhood or adolescence. This term denotes a group of conditions that cause early-onset progressive neurocognitive decline.		
MONDO:0100626	SOX11-related complex neurodevelopmental disorder with or without congenital anomalies	"An autosomal dominant disorder caused by pathogenic variation in SOX11 characterized by developmental delay, impaired intellectual development and microcephaly. Affected individuals may also have oculomotor apraxia, ocular malformations including coloboma, lens abnormalities and microphthalmia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Some patients may have finger clinodactyly and hypoplastic distal phalanges with nail hypoplasia, especially of the fifth digits. Individuals with variants in SOX11 have a \unique peripheral blood DNA methylation signature as a diagnostic biomarker and phenotypic clustering analysis that distinguishes SOX11 syndrome from BAFopathies."""		
MONDO:0100627	CFTR-related metabolic syndrome	Any metabolic syndrome in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the CRTR gene. It is characterized in infants with hypertrypsinogenemia on newborn screening who have normal or intermediate sweat chloride values and 2 CFTR mutations, including at least one that is not known to cause cystic fibrosis (CF), and thus do not meet CF Foundation guidelines for the diagnosis of CF.		
MONDO:0100628	SAMD9-related spectrum and myeloid neoplasm risk	A susceptibility or predisposition to MIRAGE syndrome and monosomy 7 myelodysplasia and leukemia syndrome 2, in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the SAMD9 gene.		
MONDO:0100629	KIF5A-related neurological disorder	Any nervous system disorder in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the KIF5A gene.		
MONDO:0100630	acquired sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy	An instance of sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy that is acquired during the lifetime of the individual. The seizures are triggered by an identifiable structural abnormality in the brain—typically detected by MRI—such as cortical dysplasia, tumors (e.g., low-grade gliomas), scars from prior injury or infection, vascular malformations (e.g., cavernomas), or post-traumatic changes.		
MONDO:0100631	sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy	A focal epilepsy syndrome with characteristic brief motor seizures occurring from sleep. This syndrome was previously known as nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, and (when familial) autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. It has both genetic and structural causes. Patients may have hyperkinetic seizures, or seizures with asymmetric dystonic/tonic motor features. The term sleep-related hyperkinetic epilepsy is to be used when patients have hyperkinetic seizures alone.		
MONDO:0700340	congenital megaprepuce	Rare congenital urological condition, subtype of buried penis, characterized by redundant inner prepuce, phimosis and deficient penile skin, leading to ballooning foreskin that can trap urine, and characterized by an abnormally large, ballooning foreskin that can trap urine, leading to ballooning during urination, difficulty emptying the bladder, and recurrent infections.		
MONDO:1010144	PLD1-related congenital heart disease	Any congenital heart disease in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the PLD1 gene.		
MONDO:1010145	PIP5K1C-related neurodevelopmental disorder	Any neurodevelopmental disorder in which the cause of the disease is a monoallelic gain-of-function variation in the PIP5K1C gene leading to increased levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate. This disorder is characterized by intellectual disability, motor and speech delay, microcephaly, seizures, visual and ocular abnormalities, and craniofacial dysmorphic features.		
MONDO:1060107	CYP7B1-related disorder of oxysterol accumulation	Any disorder of oxysterol accumulation caused by biallelic loss of function variants in the CYP7B1 gene. A disorder of oxysterol accumulation is a condition where there is an abnormal buildup of oxysterols, which are oxidized cholesterol derivatives, in the body.		
MONDO:1060108	PURA-related severe neonatal hypotonia-seizures-encephalopathy syndrome	A rare neurologic disease characterized by neonatal hypotonia, global developmental delay, feeding difficulties, and often seizures or seizure-like episodes. Other frequently observed signs and symptoms include variable dysmorphic features, myopathic facies, respiratory problems, and visual abnormalities, such as strabismus or esotropia. Brain imaging may show delayed myelination and other white matter abnormalities.		
MONDO:1060109	PLEC-related muscular dystrophy-epidermolysis bullosa simplex spectrum disorder	A spectrum of disease associated with loss or disrupted function of the PLEC gene. These disorders primarily affect the skin and muscles, leading to a range of symptoms including skin blistering (EBS), progressive muscle weakness (muscular dystrophy), and other complications.		
MONDO:1060110	HDAC4-related haploinsufficiency syndrome	A disorder caused by haploinsufficiency of HDAC4 and is characterized by brachydactyly type E, variable mild to moderate intellectual disability, seizures, autism spectrum disorder, short stature, obesity, and facial dysmorphism. Individuals with the gain of functions variants typically do not have brachydactyly and do have more consistent intellectual disability.		
MONDO:1060111	SAMD9L-related spectrum and myeloid neoplasm risk	A susceptibility or predisposition to myeloid neoplasms in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the SAMD9L gene. This condition is characterized by variable presentations of ataxia and cytopenia, myelodysplastic syndrome, monosomy 7 (acute myelogenous leukemia), and bone marrow failure.		
MONDO:1060113	Lipschütz ulcer	A genital ulcer characterized by the rapid onset of painful, necrotic ulcerations of the vulva or lower vagina. It typically occurs in sexually inactive adolescent females or young females and may be preceded by influenza-like or mononucleosis-like symptoms. Acute genital ulceration has been associated with acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection or other viral and bacterial infections. However, in many cases a cause cannot be determined.		
MONDO:1060115	TUBB4B-related ciliopathy	Any ciliopathy in which the cause of the disease is a variant in the TUBB4B gene. Please note that patient diagnoses can include disorders such as Leber congenital amaurosis and/or primary ciliary dyskinesia.		
MONDO:1060116	FDXR-related optic atrophy mitochondrial dysfunction syndrome	Any mitochondrial disorder in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the FDXR gene.		
MONDO:1060117	MYCBP2-related developmental delay with corpus callosum defects	Any neurodevelopmental disorder in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the MYCBP2 gene. This condition is characterized by variable corpus callosum defects consistent with dysgenesis, and a broad spectrum of neurobehavioural deficits including developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and autistic features.
