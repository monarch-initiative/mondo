MONDO:0100117	familial sudden death	An instance of sudden cardiac death that is caused by an inherited genomic modification in an individual.		
MONDO:0100158	CHRNG-associated hypo-akinesia disorder of prenatal onset	A spectrum of presentations resulting from biallelic protein-altering variation in CHRNG. Inactivation of the receptor during early development leads to prenatal hypo-akinesia; subsequent phenotypes are a consequence of this hypo-akinesia and are thought to be dependent upon timing and severity of the anomaly at the neuromuscular junction. A range of phenotypes varying in severity (including both lethal and non-lethal presentations) have been reported, but typically include joint contractures, pterygia, dysmorphic features, vertebral and thoracic anomalies, and additional variable abnormalities. There are no clear genotype-phenotype correlations between the lethal and non-lethal presentations of this spectrum; both inter- and intra-familial variability have been reported, with the same variants being observed in both lethal and non-lethal cases.		
MONDO:0100190	gastric intestinal metaplasia	Metaplastic changes in the lining of the upper digestive tract.		
MONDO:0100208	self-limited familial neonatal-infantile epilepsy	An epilepsy syndrome associated with infantile period seizures, complete or nearly-complete seizure remission afterwards, usually good developmental outcome, and dominant transmission with high penetrance in pedigrees. For most affected infants, seizures begin within the first week after term birth. In a minority, however, seizures can begin after the first week but within the first several months of life. At onset, seizures may be highly recurrent, and often feature unilateral tonic limb stiffening that may alternate sides from seizure to seizure, accompanied by cyanosis and autonomic features. Limb shaking movements occur, but not in the evolving rhythmic pattern of tonic-clonic convulsions in older individuals. Neurological examination of the infant is normal between seizures. Although these seizures remit by 4-12 months of age in the majority, 15-30% of those affected have one or more seizure recurrences later, including febrile seizures, focal-onset seizures, and convulsions. Although most affected children show typical development, individuals with mild learning difficulties have been reported in families where the majority develop typically.

MONDO:0100254	CACNA1A-related complex neurodevelopmental disorder	A progressive complex neurodevelopmental condition caused by variants in the CACNA1A gene. Phenotypic onset (usually) occurs around age 1 and most often includes intellectual disability but can also include epileptic encephalopathy, benign paroxysmal torticollis of infancy and paroxysmal tonic upgaze psychomotor delay, learning difficulties, absence epilepsy, episodic ataxia, and hemiplegic migraines.

MONDO:0700046	baclofen withdrawal syndrome	Withdrawal syndrome involving the abrupt discontinuation of baclofen therapy (intrathecal or oral).
