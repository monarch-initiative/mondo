MONDO:0100619	variable age epilepsy syndrome	An epilepsy syndrome that has an onset during variable ages and stages of life.		
MONDO:0100620	developmental and epileptic encephalopathy	An epilepsy associated with developmental impairment that may be due to either the underlying etiology or the superimposed epileptic activity, or both.		
MONDO:0100621	acquired developmental and epileptic encephalopathy	An instance of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy that is acquired during the lifetime of the individual.		
MONDO:0100623	meningitis-retention syndrome	A neuro-urological condition characterized by aseptic meningitis, typically without any clear causative agent, associated with acute urinary retention. The typical symptoms and neurological signs of aseptic meningitis are usually mild or absent, so the predominant symptom often turns out to be isolated acute urinary retention. Although several cases are reported in the literature, MRS actual prevalence is underestimated. These factors make an early diagnosis of MRS difficult.

MONDO:0700291	glycogen storage disease IX	A group of inborn errors of glycogen metabolism that is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. This group comprises GSD due to liver phosphorylase kinase (PhK) deficiency, GSD due to muscle PhK deficiency and GSD due to liver and muscle PhK deficiency.

MONDO:0700301	Fischer-Zirnsak progeroid syndrome			
MONDO:0700303	Erb palsy	A palsy characterized by a paralysis of the arm caused by an injury to the upper group of the main nerves supplying it, specifically the upper trunk C5-C6 of the brachial plexus. Erb palsy most commonly, though not exclusively, arises as a result of an injury sustained during birth.		
MONDO:0700340	congenital megaprepuce	Rare congenital urological condition, subtype of buried penis, characterized by redundant inner prepuce, phimosis and deficient penile skin, leading to ballooning foreskin that can trap urine, and characterized by an abnormally large, ballooning foreskin that can trap urine, leading to ballooning during urination, difficulty emptying the bladder, and recurrent infections.		
MONDO:1010144	PLD1-related congenital heart disease	Any congenital heart disease in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the PLD1 gene.		
MONDO:1010145	PIP5K1C-related neurodevelopmental disorder	Any neurodevelopmental disorder in which the cause of the disease is a monoallelic gain-of-function variation in the PIP5K1C gene leading to increased levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate. This disorder is characterized by intellectual disability, motor and speech delay, microcephaly, seizures, visual and ocular abnormalities, and craniofacial dysmorphic features.		
MONDO:1060107	CYP7B1-related disorder of oxysterol accumulation	Any disorder of oxysterol accumulation caused by biallelic loss of function variants in the CYP7B1 gene. A disorder of oxysterol accumulation is a condition where there is an abnormal buildup of oxysterols, which are oxidized cholesterol derivatives, in the body.
