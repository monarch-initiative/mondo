MONDO:0800117	cutaneous botryomycosis	A botromycosis that involves the skin and subcutaneous tissue (it is a more common type).		
MONDO:0800118	visceral botryomycosis	A botryomycosis that involves internal organs such as lungs, liver, or brain. It is a rare disease and has been described mainly in patients with underlying diseases such as diabetes mellitus, cystic fibrosis, or HIV infection. It is most commonly affecting the lungs, although involvement of other organs including liver, spleen, kidney, and brain has also been described.		
MONDO:0800119	postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans	An irreversible obstructive lung disease characterized by subepithelial inflammation and fibrotic narrowing of the bronchioles after lower respiratory tract infection during childhood, especially early childhood. Although diagnosis of PIBO should be confirmed by histopathology, it is generally based on history and clinical findings. Irreversible airway obstruction is demonstrated by decreased forced expiratory volume in 1 second with an absent bronchodilator response, and by mosaic perfusion, air trapping, and/or bronchiectasis on computed tomography images. However, lung function tests using spirometry are not feasible in young children, and most cases of PIBO develop during early childhood.		
MONDO:0800120	Mac-Leod-Swyer-James-Syndrome	A rare lung condidtion characterized by often predominantly unilateral lung hyperlucency and air trapping. The condition is a post-infectious form of bronchiolitis obliterans and typically follows a viral respiratory infection in infancy and childhood. Adenovirus infection is considered the most usual epidemiology. In SJS, the involved lung or portion of the lung does not grow normally and is slightly smaller than the opposite lung: in particular, peripheral branches of the pulmonary vessels do not develop, and vasculature is arreseted at the stage at which the infection occurred. Patients respond well to management with bronchodilators, even though this is not primarily a bronchial abnormality.		
MONDO:0800121	cellular interstitial pneumonitis	An interstitial lung disease specific to infancy that is characterized by tachypnea at birth and persistent disease, diffuse interstitial thickening due to pale oval and spindle-shaped histiocytes without scarring.		
MONDO:0800123	bronchiolocentric pattern of interstitial pneumonia	An interstitial lung disease characterized histologically by fibrosis and/or inflammation confined to the alveolar interstitium around bronchovascular bundles, overlapping with peribronchial metaplasia, fibrosis in some series and the lack of interstitial granulomas.		
MONDO:0800124	Lane Hamilton syndrome	A rare concurrent association of idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis and celiac disease, and is typically seen in children under the age of 15.		
MONDO:0800125	disseminated visceral giant cell angiitis	A necrotizing vasculitis characterized by widespread small-vessel giant cell angitis and extravascular granulomas.		
MONDO:0800126	dystrophic pulmonary ossification	A rare lung disorder characterized by ectopic bone formation within lung parenchyma. DPO can be idiopathic or associated with a variety of cardiovascular, respiratory diseases or other disorders. There are mainly two forms of DPO: nodular and dendriform.		
MONDO:0800127	pulmonary amyloidosis	A rare hereditary amyloidosis that incorporates deposition of amyloid microfibril material in the lung parenchyma.		
MONDO:0800128	combined immunodeficiency due to POLE2 deficiency	Any combined immunodeficiency due to a deficiency in the POLE2 gene.		
MONDO:0800129	autoinflammatory disease, X-linked	An autoinflammatory syndrome characterized by the onset of systemic autoinflammation in the first months of life. Features include lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, fever, panniculitis, and nodular skin rash. Additional manifestations may include inflammation of the optic nerve, intracranial hemorrhage, and lipodystrophy.		
MONDO:0800130	autoinflammatory syndrome with immunodeficiency	An autoinflammatory syndrome characterized by onset of various autoimmune features usually in the first decades of life, although later onset has been reported. Typical features include autoimmune cytopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphadenopathy. More variable features may include autoimmune thyroiditis, psoriasis or eczema, nephritis, hepatitis, and symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SL). Some patients may have recurrent infections or exacerbation of the disease with acute infection. Laboratory studies show variable findings, often decreased numbers of naive B cells, lymphopenia with skewed subsets, hypogammaglobulinemia, presence of autoantibodies, and a hyperinflammatory state. The disorder shows autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance.		
MONDO:0800131	hyper-IgE recurrent infection syndrome 4A, autosomal dominant	An immunologic disorder characterized by recurrent mainly sinopulmonary infections associated with increased serum IgE. The phenotype is variable, even within families. Some patients have onset of symptoms in early childhood and develop complications, including bronchiectasis or hemoptysis, whereas others have later onset of less severe infections. Immunologic workup usually shows normal leukocyte levels, although some patients may demonstrate alterations in lymphocyte subsets, including T cells. Affected individuals also have variable skeletal abnormalities, including high-arched palate, hyperextensible joints, scoliosis, and bone fractures. The IL6ST mutations are loss-of-function, although the truncated mutant proteins are expressed and interfere with the wildtype protein in a dominant-negative manner by disrupting IL6 and IL11 signaling.		
MONDO:0800132	autoinflammatory-pancytopenia syndrome due to DNASE2 deficiency	An autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe anemia and thrombocytopenia apparent from early infancy, hepatosplenomegaly, and recurrent fevers associated with a hyperinflammatory state. Additional systemic features may include chronic diarrhea, proteinuria with renal disease, liver fibrosis with elevated liver enzymes, deforming arthropathy, and vasculitic skin lesions. Some patients may have motor delay or learning difficulties associated with subcortical white matter lesions on brain imaging. Laboratory studies show increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), consistent with a type I interferonopathy.		
MONDO:0800133	pulmonary hypoplasia	A respiratory malformation characterized by the presence of both bronchi (albeit rudimentary) and alveoli in an under-developed lobe. Both the size and the weight of the lung are reduced. The true prevalence is not well known (1.4% of all births according to Knox et al. 13), but in cases of premature rupture of membranes at 15-28 weeks gestation, the reported prevalence of pulmonary hypoplasia ranges from 9 to 28%. Factors that contribute to pulmonary hypoplasia include adequate volume of the thoracic cavity, pulmonary fluid dynamics, and abnormal fetal breathing movements.		
MONDO:0800174	encephalitis, acute, infection-induced, susceptibility to	An inherited susceptibility or predisposition to developing encephalitis, acute, infection-induced.		
MONDO:0800175	cardiogenic shock	A rare, cardiac condition characterized by severely decreased cardiac output, hypoperfusion and end-organ dysfunction, in the presence of adequate intravascular volume. The clinical presentation is variable and may range from subtle hemodynamic alterations to overt cardiovascular collapse. Commonly reported features include dyspnea, crackles, elevated jugular venous pressure, altered mental state, abnormal pulse pressure, oliguria, cold extremities, and increased serum lactate levels.		
MONDO:0800176	black widow spider envenomation	Local and/or systemic toxicity resulting from a bite from a black widow spider (Latrodectus species).		
MONDO:0800177	frostbite	An injury to the skin and/or its underlying tissues that results from exposure of the affected area to extreme cold.

MONDO:0800181	OPA1-related optic atrophy with or without extraocular features	Any primary mitochondrial disease in which the cause of the disease is monoallelic or biallelic variants in the OPA1 gene. While optic atrophy is present in most affected cases, OPA1 is a mitochondrial protein and thus features of this disease include abnormal mitochondrial morphology and multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions, and can affect other organ systems and. Extraocular features can include progressive sensorineural hearing impairment, cognitive impairment, peripheral neuropathy, myopathy, ragged-red muscle fibers, and exercise-induced lactic acidemia, while additional ocular features can include progressive visual loss, central scotoma, and color vision abnormalities.
