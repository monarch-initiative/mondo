MONDO:0100620	developmental and epileptic encephalopathy	An epilepsy associated with developmental impairment that may be due to either the underlying etiology or the superimposed epileptic activity, or both.

MONDO:0100623	meningitis-retention syndrome	A neuro-urological condition characterized by aseptic meningitis, typically without any clear causative agent, associated with acute urinary retention. The typical symptoms and neurological signs of aseptic meningitis are usually mild or absent, so the predominant symptom often turns out to be isolated acute urinary retention. Although several cases are reported in the literature, MRS actual prevalence is underestimated. These factors make an early diagnosis of MRS difficult.
