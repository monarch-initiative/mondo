MONDO:0100463	methylmalonic aciduria and/or homocystinuria, cblD type	An autosomal recessive inborn disorder of cobalamin metabolism caused by biallelic variants in MMADHC. Depending on the type and location of variants in MMADHC, patients may present with methylmalonic aciduria, homocystinuria, or both. MMADHC has been reported to result in the cblD complementation group of cobalamin disorders.		
MONDO:0100464	acid sphingomyelinase deficiency	An autosomal recessive lysosomal disease caused by biallelic loss of function variants in the SMPD1 gene. Clinical symptoms in affected individuals occur along a continuum. At the severe end of the spectrum are individuals historically diagnosed with Niemann-Pick disease type A (the neurovisceral form), which is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly with rapid neurological deterioration leading to death in the first few years of life. At the milder end of the spectrum are individuals historically diagnosed with Niemann-Pick disease type B, a later-onset, chronic visceral form, characterized by progressive visceral organ symptoms including hepatosplenomegaly and pulmonary insufficiency, and survival into adulthood. In addition, some affected individuals present with an intermediate phenotype, Niemann-Pick disease type A/B.		
MONDO:0100465	complex neurodevelopmental disorder with or without congenital anomalies	A complex neurodevelopmental disorder that involves more than one phenotype associated with the central nervous system, including but not limited to intellectual disability, autism, and seizures (epilepsy), in addition to one or more structural or functional anomaly(ies) that develops prenatally.		
MONDO:0700073	glutaric acidemia IIa	Any multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the ETFA gene.		
MONDO:0700074	glutaric acidemia IIb	Any multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the ETFB gene.		
MONDO:0700076	glutaric acidemia IIc	Any multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the ETFDH gene.		
MONDO:0800042	restrictive dermopathy 1	A a neonatal lethal genetic disease characterized by very tight and thin skin with erosions and scaling, associated to a typical facial dysmorphism, arthrogryposis multiplex, fetal akinesia or hypokinesia deformation sequence (FADS) and pulmonary hypoplasia without neurological abnormalities.		
MONDO:0800043	St√ºve-Wiedemann syndrome 1	A rare autosomal recessive congenital primary skeletal dysplasia, characterized by small stature, bowing of the long bones, camptodactyly, hyperthermic episodes, respiratory distress/apneic episodes and feeding difficulties that usually lead to early mortality.		
MONDO:0800044	congenital disorder of deglycosylation 1	A rare autosomal recessive inherited disorder caused by mutations in the NGLY1 gene. It is characterized by developmental delay, hypotonia, abnormal involuntary movements, poor tear production, microcephaly, intractable seizures, abnormal eye movements, and liver abnormalities.		
MONDO:0800045	autoinflammatory syndrome, familial, Behcet-like 1			
MONDO:0800063	primordial dwarfism and slender bone disorder	A skeletal dysplsia characterized by primordial dwarfism, an extreme growth deficiency disorder that has its onset during embryonic development and persists throughout life and slender bone disorder, a heterogeneous group of neonatal dwarfism syndromes, usually of unknown etiology, associated with gracile (thin) bones, multiple fractures, and prenatal or early postnatal death.		
MONDO:0800064	osteogenesis imperfecta and a reduction of bone mineral density.	A skeletal dysplasia characterized by osteogenesis imperfecta and decreased bone density.		
MONDO:0800066	polydactyly-syndactyly-triphalangism	Any skeletal dysplasia that is characterizedby polydactyly, syndactyly and triphalangism, where a digit has three phalanges instead of two.		
MONDO:0800075	dysostosis with predominant vertebral with and without costal involvement	Any dysostosis that involves the vertebrae, with or without involvement of the the ribs or the upper sides of the body.
