MONDO:0100580	epilepsy, onset unknown	An epilepsy in which the type of seizure onset is unknown or unclear, making it uncertain whether it is a generalized or focal epilepsy. Seizures of unknown onset may still have features that can be classified.		
MONDO:0100582	TOR1AIP1-related myopathy	A congenital myopathy in which the cause of the disease is pathogenic variation in the TOR1AIP1 gene. May include fatigable muscle weakness resulting from impaired transmission at the neuromuscular synapse.		
MONDO:0100583	Jeune syndrome - GRK2-related	A form of Jeune syndrome caused by biallelic loss-of-function variants in the GRK2 gene.		
MONDO:0100584	SNUPN-related muscular dystrophy with or without multi-system involvement	A form of congenital muscular dystrophy in which the cause of the disease is pathogenic variation in the SNUPN gene. The phenotype is typically characterized by a variable degree of muscle weakness, elevated serum creatinine kinase, and myopathic signs in skeletal muscle. Extra-muscular features involving the ocular, skeletal, respiratory, and central nervous system may also be present.		
MONDO:0700335	familial isolated dilated cardiomyopathy	A rare familial cardiomyopathy characterized by the dilation of left ventricle and progressively impairing of systolic ventricular function, in the absence of abnormal loading conditions or coronary artery disease sufficient to cause global systolic impairment. The disease may cause heart failure or arrhythmia. The disease is isolated when no additional atypical cardiac or extracardiac manifestations are present.		
MONDO:0700336	peritoneal carcinomatosis	Cancer in which a carcinoma, usually of the digestive tract or female reproductive organs, has spread extensively throughout the peritoneum and causes tumors to grow on the peritoneum. Peritoneal carcinomatosis can happen in many types of cancer, but it is most common in people with cancers of the ovary, colon, rectum, stomach, pancreas, or appendix.		
MONDO:0700337	renal tubular dysgenesis - ACE	Any renal tubular dysgenesis in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the ACE gene.		
MONDO:0700338	autoinflammation, panniculitis, and dermatosis syndrome, autosomal dominant			
MONDO:0800487	variable-age onset idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndrome	Any idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndrome that has a variable-age onset.		
MONDO:0800488	neonatal/infantile-onset self-limited epilepsy syndrome	An epilepsy syndrome characterized by the onset of seizures in neonates/infants where there is a high likelihood of spontaneously remitting at a predictable age.		
MONDO:0800489	genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus spectrum	A neonatal/infantile-onset self-limited familial syndrome characterized by the presence of febrile seizures in an individual with a family history of seizures/epilepsy. Febrile seizures may be typical febrile seizures or 'febrile seizures plus' (FS+) may occur, where febrile seizures continue past 6 years of age and/or are accompanied by afebrile seizures which may be generalized or focal. FS+ and GEFS+ are distinguished on the basis of family history. A number of dominantly inherited genes have been linked to both GEFS+ and FS+, with implications for specific genetic counselling, due to the variable severity of the epilepsy in different family members. Although febrile seizures are the hallmark of this familial syndrome, not all individuals in a family may have these.		
MONDO:0800490	neonatal/infantile-onset epilepsy syndrome with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy	A neonatal/infantile epilepsy syndrome characterized by the onset of non-self-limiting seizures and developmental regression or delay in infants/neonates. This condition is typically caused by genetic mutations that disrupt normal brain development, affecting both cognitive and motor development that is not responsive to typical seizure treatments.		
MONDO:0800491	early-infantile DEE	A neonatal/infantile epilepsy syndrome characterized by frequent drug-resistant seizures that begin ≤3 months of age, with abnormal interictal EEG and neurological examination.		
MONDO:0800492	variable-age onset focal epilepsy syndrome	An epilepsy syndrome characterized by focal seizures where age at seizure onset varies.		
MONDO:0800493	familial mesial temporal lobe epilepsy	A focal epilepsy syndrome where the age at onset is typically in adolescence or adulthood. Affected individuals have focal aware seizures with mesial temporal lobe features, especially prominent déjà vu. Most patients have a normal MRI, and seizures respond to treatment. A subgroup is recognised that have antecedent febrile seizures, hippocampal atrophy, and drug resistant seizures. Direct questioning of relatives may be required to identify this familial epilepsy syndrome, as many individuals consider their déjà vu experiences as mild and they may not have been diagnosed as seizures.		
MONDO:0800494	variable-age onset combined generalized and focal epilepsy syndrome	An epilepsy syndrome characterized by a combined generalized and focal epilepsy syndromes where age at seizure onset varies.		
MONDO:0800495	variable-age epilepsy syndrome with developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathy or progressive neurological deterioration	An epilepsy syndrome characterized by seizures along with developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathy or progressive neurological deterioration where age at seizure onset varies.		
MONDO:0800496	epilepsy with auditory features	A variable-age onset focal epilepsy syndrome with characteristic focal aware sensory auditory seizures. Seizures often produce such mild symptoms that they are not diagnosed. There are no implications expected for development or learning and seizures are typically infrequent and well controlled. EAF may occur as a familial syndrome, familial EAF (FEAF, previous known as autosomal dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy or autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features). Inheritance may be autosomal dominant (ADEAF), with incomplete penetrance.		
MONDO:0800498	childhood-onset genetic generalized epilepsy syndrome	A genetic generalized epilepsy that has an onset during childhood.		
MONDO:0800499	childhood-onset idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndrome	An idiopathic generalized epilepsy that has an onset during childhood.		
MONDO:0800500	childhood-onset epilepsy syndrome with developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathy	A childhood-onset epilepsy syndrome where the onset of the condition includes manifestations of cognitive, neurological, or psychiatric impairment, stagnation, or regression, due directly to the underlying etiology. In contrast, an epileptic encephalopathy (EE) is present when the encephalopathy is caused by the epileptic activity. The term developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) is used when both factors contribute to the patient’s condition.		
MONDO:0800501	developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathy with spike-wave activation in sleep	A spectrum of conditions with varied degree of cognitive, language, behavioral, and motor regression associated with marked spike-wave activation in sleep. The regression is seen within weeks of the EEG pattern. This syndrome encompasses the previous syndromes epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-wave in sleep and atypical childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (also previously known as pseudo-Lennox syndrome and atypical benign partial epilepsy). Landau–Kleffner syndrome is a specific subtype of EE-SWAS, where regression affects mainly language, with an acquired auditory agnosia.		
MONDO:0800502	childhood-onset self-limited focal epilepsy syndrome	A group of conditions characterized by age-dependent occurrence in otherwise normal children. Cognition and neurological evaluation are typically normal. Remission occurs in almost all patients by puberty. Presumed genetic factors have an important role. Seizure semiology and electroencephalographic (EEG) features are specific for each of the syndromes included in this group.		
MONDO:0800503	TMEM63B-related developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with anemia	A developmental and epileptic encephalopathy caused by variation in the TMEM63B gene.
