Differential diagnostic with intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring is mandatory as neuroimaging fails to distinguish it from functional conus.		
MONDO:0958349	dorsal spinal cord lipoma	A rare lipomatous, dysraphic malformation characterized by attachment to the dorsal surface of the spinal cord but not extending to the conus. It can be associated with others features such as a stalk and vertebral bone abnormalities.
