MONDO:0700289	combined immunodeficiency syndrome	A combined immunodeficiency in which other clinical features are present in other organ systems in addition to immunodeficiency.		
MONDO:0700306	FASLG-related immunodeficiency	An immunodeficiency disease in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the FASLG gene.		
MONDO:0700308	TNFRSF9-related immunodeficiency	An immunodeficiency disease in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the TNFRSF9 gene.		
MONDO:0700311	DNAJC21-related Shwachman Diamond syndrome	A Shwachman Diamond syndrome in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the DNAJC21 gene.		
MONDO:0700327	IRF4-related immune disorder	An immune disorder in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the interferon activation domain of the IRF4 gene.		
MONDO:0700330	PTEN harmartoma tumor syndrome with immune disorder			
MONDO:0700333	TREX1-related autosomal dominant Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome	Autosomal dominant form of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome 1.		
MONDO:0700351	argyrophilic grain disease	A tauopathy characterized pathologically by the presence of silver stain positive lesions called argyrophilic grains, oligodendrocytic coiled bodies, and neuronal tau-positive pretangles.		
MONDO:0800497	interstitial lung disease 2	An interstitial lung disease in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the SFTPA2 gene.		
MONDO:0800504	idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis	An interstitial lung disease with a poor prognosis, that is characterized by the progressive formation of scar tissue within the lungs in the absence of any known cause.		
MONDO:1010173	IRF4-related combined immunodeficiency	A combined immunodeficiency in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the IRF4 gene.		
MONDO:1010174	NFATC1-related combined immunodeficiency	A combined immunodeficiency in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the NFATC1 gene.		
MONDO:1010175	POLD2-related combined immunodeficiency	A non-severe combined immunodeficiency due to polymerase delta deficiency in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the POLD2 gene.		
MONDO:1010176	POLD3-related combined immunodeficiency	A combined immunodeficiency in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the POLD3 gene.		
MONDO:1010177	IKZF2-related combined immunodeficiency	A combined immunodeficiency syndrome in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the IKZF2 gene.		
MONDO:1010178	CHD7-related CHARGE syndrome	A CHARGE syndrome in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the CHD7 gene.		
MONDO:1060120	ACO2-related optic atrophy with or without extraocular features	An optic atrophy in which the cause of the disease is monoallelic or biallelic variants in the ACO2 gene. ACO2 is a mitochondrial protein and thus, in addition to the optic atrophy features, features of this disease include abnormal mitochondrial morphology and can affect other organ systems. Extraocular features can include ataxia, spastic paraplegia, CNS abnormalities, neurodevelopmental phenotypes, and retinal degeneration.		
MONDO:1060159	complex movement disorder with or without neurodevelopmental features	A movement disorder characterized by having one or more different types of movement disorders, such as abnormal muscle tone, abnormal degree of movement, dystonia or torsion, which may occur with or without neurodevelopmental features, such as developmental delay or intellectual disability.		
MONDO:1060161	inherited distal renal tubular acidosis	A form of distal renal tubular acidosis that is inherited.		
MONDO:1060162	acquired distal renal tubular acidosis	A form of distal renal tular acidosis that develops secondary to another condition, usually disease or drug.		
MONDO:1060165	ELANE-related neutropenia	Any neutropenia in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the ELANE gene.		
MONDO:1060166	giant cell hepatitis with autoimmune hemolytic anemia	A rare autoimmune disease of early childhood, marked by the simultaneous or sequential immune attack on red blood cells and liver cells.		
MONDO:1060169	HAVCR2-related cancer predisposition	Hereditary cancer predisposition due to variation(s) in the HAVCR2 gene, which confers the predisposition to susceptibility to subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL) and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Affected individuals typically present with multiple subcutaneous nodules and systemic B symptoms.		
MONDO:1060171	diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27-altered	A diffuse midline glioma characterized by H3 K27 alteration and usually either a histone H3 K27M mutation, an EGFR mutation, or aberrant overexpression of EZHIP. The prognosis is poor.		
MONDO:1060173	FLNB-associated autosomal dominant filamin related bone disorder	Any autosomal dominant filamin related bone disorder in which the cause of the disease is a variation in FLNB gene.		
MONDO:1060174	systemic lupus erythematosus related to C1QA	Any systemic lupus erythematosus in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the C1QA gene.		
MONDO:1060176	systemic lupus erythematosus related to C1S	Any systemic lupus erythematosus in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the C1S gene.
