Monoallelic variants predispose to acute/episodic attacks in adulthood with abdominal pain, neuropathy, and neuropsychiatric symptoms (women are more often affected) without cutaneous manifestations. Triggers precipitating acute attacks include estrogen/progesterone, oral contraceptives, alcohol, drugs, stress, or infections. Biallelic variants cause severe disease in childhood presenting with neurological issues including developmental abnormalities, ataxia, dysarthria, leukoencephalopathy, cataracts and optic nerve hypoplasia.		
MONDO:0700383	PPOX-related hepatic porphyria	A hepatic porphyria (or variegate porphyria) caused by monoallelic and biallelic variants in PPOX, presenting as a spectrum of disease (a semidominant inheritance pattern). Cases caused by monoallelic variants may have onset during adolescence or adulthood and are episodic characterized by abdominal pain, constipation, vomiting, muscular paralysis, and psychosis. Other symptoms may include abnormal blistering of the skin, cutaneous photosensitivity, and neuropathy. Triggers precipitating acute attacks include estrogen/progesterone, oral contraceptives, alcohol, drugs, stress, or infections. Cases caused by biallelic variants, which reduce enzyme activity to <25% of normal, typically result in child or adolescent onset with greater severity. Symptoms for this extend to brachydactyly, clinodactyly, intellectual disability, nystagmus, myopia, growth retardation, and hyperpigmentation.		
MONDO:0700384	porphyria, acute intermittent, nonerythroid variant	A HMBS-related hepatic porphyria subtype caused by variants in HMBS exon 1, which is not expressed in erythrocytes, causing HMBS activity in erythrocytes to be at a normal level. The housekeeping promoter produces the HMBS transcript containing exons 1 and 3-15. In contrast, erythrocytes use an erythroid-specific promoter downstream of the housekeeping HMBS promoter to produce a transcript that contains only exons 2-15. Therefore deleterious variants occurring within exon 1 or affecting the splicing of exon 1 to exon 3 do not impact the erythrocyte isozyme, but do impact the more broadly expressed housekeeping isozyme.
