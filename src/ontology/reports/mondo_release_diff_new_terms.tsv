MONDO:0100434	chronic mountain sickness	A pathological condition resulting from chronic exposure to hypoxia at high altitude. The syndrome is characterized by an excessive number of red blood cells associated with a high blood hemoglobin concentration ([Hb]), hypoxemia, and, in some cases, pulmonary hypertension. Clinical signs include headache, fatigue, sleep disturbances, dyspnea, digestive complaints, and high risk of thrombotic events.		
MONDO:0100440	Asperger syndrome, susceptibility to	An inherited susceptibility or predisposition to developing Asperger sydrome.		
MONDO:0100473	disorder of peptide and amine metabolism	An inherited metabolic disease that has its basis in the disruption of peptide and/or amine metabolic process.		
MONDO:0100477	disorder of methylamine metabolism	An inherited metabolic disease that has its basis in the disruption of methylamine metabolic process.		
MONDO:0100509	IFT140-related recessive ciliopathy	Any ciliopathy in which the cause of the disease is biallelic variants in the IFT140 gene.		
MONDO:0100510	spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia	An osteochondrodysplasia that results in abnormalities of bone growth in the vertebral column, epiphysis, and metaphysis.

MONDO:0100515	mirror movements 1 and/or agenesis of the corpus callosum	A familial congenital mirror movement disorder where individuals with heterozygous variants in DCC have congenital mirror movements and/or agenesis of the corpus callosum (not with or without- some individuals do not demonstrate mirror movements and only have corpus callosum defects, even within the same family).		
MONDO:0100516	complex neurodevelopmental disorder with motor features	A complex neurodevelopmental disorder that involves more than one phenotype associated with the central nervous system, including but not limited to intellectual disability, autism, and seizures (epilepsy). Additionally, the disorder features at least one phenotype associated with motor function, including but not limited to spasticity, hypo- or hypertonia, dyskinesia, choreo-athetosis, or ataxia.
