MONDO:0100591	TOR1AIP1-related multisystem disorder	TOR1AIP1-related multisystem disorder is a rare, early-onset disorder affecting multiple organ systems that is caused by variation in the TOR1AIP1 gene. Clinical features reported in affected individuals are variable but may include hypotonia, dystonia, cerebellar atrophy, contractures, cardiomyopathy, microcephaly, cataract, deafness, skeletal anomalies, progeroid appearance and other facial dysmorphism, and nephrolithiasis.

This includes SLC26A2-related achondrogenesis, SLC26A2-related atelosteogenesis, SLC26A2-related diastrophic dysplasia, and SLC26A2-related multiple epiphyseal dysplasia.		
MONDO:0100593	COMP-related skeletal dysplasia	Any skeletal disorder in which the cause of the disease is a variant in the COMP gene. This includes pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia.

MONDO:0100603	FAT4-related neurodevelopmental disorder	Any neurodevelopmental disorder, frequently presenting with lymphatic dysplasia, craniofacial and limb anomalies, and secondary lymphopenia from altered immune cell trafficking, in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the FAT4 gene.		
MONDO:0100604	TOR1AIP1-related nuclear envelopathy	A hereditary disease that encompasses the spectrum of clinical phenotypes resulting from loss of function of the TOR1AIP1 gene, including TOR1AIP1-related myopathy and TOR1AIP1-related multisystem disorder. Variability in the specific clinical features resulting from variants disrupting the function the TOR1AIP1 gene is thought to depend on the differential effects of variants on TOR1AIP1 transcript isoforms, for which there is evidence for tissue-specific expression and function.		
MONDO:0100605	POLR-related leukodystrophy	A rare hypomyelinating leukodystrophy disorder in which the cause of the disease is a variation in any of the POLR genes, including POLR1C, POLR3A or POLR3B. It is characterized by the association of dental abnormalities (delayed dentition, abnormal order of dentition, hypodontia), hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and hypomyelinating leukodystrophy manifesting with neurodevelopmental delay or regression and/or progressive cerebellar symptoms.		
MONDO:0100606	COL1A2-related Ehlers-Danlos syndrome	Any Ehler-Danlos syndrome caused by any variant in the COL1A2 gene.		
MONDO:0100607	ciliary dyskinesia, primary, 54	Any primary ciliary dyskinesia in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the CFAP54 gene.		
MONDO:0100608	ALPL-related autosomal dominant hypophosphatasia	Any hypophosphatasia in which the cause of the disease is a variant with a dominant negative effect or haploinsufficiency in the ALPL gene.		
MONDO:0100609	ALPL-related autosomal recessive hypophosphatasia	Any hypophosphatasia in which the cause of the disease is an autosomal recessive loss-of-function in the ALPL gene.		
MONDO:0100614	syndromic congenital heart disease	Congenital heart disease with co-occurrence of other extracardiac congenital anomalies, or well characterized genetic conditions.		
MONDO:0100615	intestinal failureâ€“associated liver disease	Liver disease found in patients on parenteral nutrition for intestinal failure. May develop with few clinical features.		
MONDO:0100617	VPS11-related neurological disorder	Any neurological disorder in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the VPS11 gene.
