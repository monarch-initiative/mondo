Patients are frequently asymptomatic, although chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, dizziness, syncope, and sudden cardiac arrest/death (typically following intense physical exertion) may be observed. This malformation is associated with a high risk of sudden cardiac death so surgical revascularization is recommended even in cases with no associated evidence of myocardial ischemia. [Orphanet:541443]	True	
MONDO:0035250	obsolete anomalous aortic origin of the right coronary artery	OBSOLETE. A rare coronary artery congenital malformation characterized by an anomalous origin and course of the right coronary artery, which originates from the left aortic sinus of Valsalva and has an abnormal proximal course, which may be intramural, prepulmonic, subpulmonic, retroaortic, retrocardiac or wrapped around the apex. Patients are frequently asymptomatic, although chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, dizziness, syncope, and sudden cardiac arrest/death (typically following intense physical exertion) may be observed. This malformation is associated with a lower risk of sudden cardiac death therefore surgical revascularization is recommended only when signs and/or symptoms of ischemia are present. [Orphanet:541454]	True	
MONDO:0035251	obsolete anomalous aortic origin of coronary artery	OBSOLETE.

Clinical manifestations depend on the specific anomalous origin and course which is present, with patients being frequently asymptomatic, although nonspecific chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, dyspnea or syncope, usually following physical exertion, may be associated. Sudden death, due to compression/occlusion of the coronary artery and usually associated with, or immediately following, vigorous physical exercise, may be occasionally observed.

Infants typically present with feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, dyspnea, irritability, hyperhidrosis, heart murmurs, tachypnea, tachycardia and/or chest pain while adults usually associate dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, and intolerance to physical exercise. Sudden death may occur due to congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, valvular insufficiencies or ventricular arrhythmias. The majority of cases reported are of an ALCAPA, while ARCAPA is rarely observed. [Orphanet:541507]	True

Patients usually become symptomatic in the fifth to sixth decade of life and may present with palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue, pedal edema, and syncope. In severe cases, congestive heart failure can be the presenting symptom. [Orphanet:542568]	True

Attacks may be accompanied by nailbed, tongue, submandibular, and gluteal abscesses, intra-abdominal granulomas, pyoderma gangrenosum, and buccal ulcerations. Frequent episodes of purulent paronychia, superficial skin and mucosal infections, and purulent upper respiratory tract infections have also been reported.

MONDO:0035444	acute mast cell leukemia	A rare systemic mastocytosis characterized by the presence of at least 20% usually immature and atypical mast cells in bone marrow aspirate smears. In classic mast cell leukemia, mast cells account for at least 10% of peripheral white blood cells, although the aleukemic variant with less than 10% mast cells is more common. C-findings (cytopenias, hepatomegaly, ascites, portal hypertension, splenomegaly, skeletal lesions, malabsorption), indicative of organ damage due to mast cell infiltration, are usually present at diagnosis, while skin lesions are absent in most cases. Prognosis is generally poor.		
MONDO:0035445	chronic mast cell leukemia	A rare form of mast cell leukemia characterized by the presence of at least 20% mast cells in bone marrow aspirate smears but often mature mast cell morphology, low proliferation rate, and absence of organ damage and C findings (cytopenias, hepatomegaly, ascites, portal hypertension, splenomegaly, skeletal lesions, malabsorption). The disease course is less aggressive than in the acute form, although patients may later progress.
