MONDO:0100556	PRRT2-associated paroxysmal movement disorder	A group of rare movement and seizure disorders caused by changes (disease-causing variants or mutations) in the PRRT2 gene. They include a spectrum of specific disorders including paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD), benign familial infantile epilepsy (BFIE), paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia with infantile convulsions (PKD/IC) and hemiplegic migraine (HM). In addition, PRRT2 pathogenic variants have been identified in other childhood-onset movement disorders and different types of seizure conditions, such as paroxysmal torticollis, episodic ataxia and familial paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia.

MONDO:0958343	PAPASH syndrome	A rare autoinflammatory syndrome characterized by a chronic-relapsing course of the combination of pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, and hidradenitis suppurativa (which, in addition to axillae and inguinal folds, can be observed on the face, neck, scalp, back, and buttocks, among others). Typical age of onset is adolescence to young adulthood, with the different signs and symptoms appearing simultaneously or subsequently.		
MONDO:0958344	spinal dermal sinus	A rare closed dysraphism with stalk characterized by a dorsal midline dermal sinus tract lined by keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium extending to the the intrathecal space. Other components such as hair follicles and shafts, mesenchymal derivatives (blood vessels and fibrous tissue) and occasionally nerve fibers can be observed. Inflamed granulation tissue containing mixed neutrophils, plasma cells, lymphocytes, and histiocytes is consistently found in the tract. It can also be associated with an intradural dermoid cyst. This malformation is at risk to cause intrathecal infections (meningitis, empyema) that justify a prophylactic surgery.		
MONDO:0958345	limited dorsal myeloschisis	A rare dysraphic abnormality characterized by a persistent connection between the neural tissue and overlying skin. The stalk-like connection consists of a fibroneural tract (mainly composed of fibrous attenuated mesenchymal tissue and neural elements without an epithelial lining) connecting the skin lesion to the underlying dorsal surface of the spinal cord. Fibroneural stalk varies in thickness and complexity and they pass through the deep fascia, a bifid lamina/ the interspinous ligament, and the dura. It can be associated with filum anomaly. Chiari II malformation is not present.		
MONDO:0958346	isolated transitional filum lipoma	A rare dysraphic abnormality characterized by the infiltration of fatty tissue localized in the filum terminale, with abnormal conus shape. The spinal cord is typically attenuated and the limit between its end and the fatty filum is hard to distinguish. There are no additional spinal cord malformation, but it can be associated with vertebral abnormalities, anorectal malformation or other syndromic condition. It is named transitional for its intermediate image between an isolated filum lipoma and a terminal conus region lipoma.		
MONDO:0958347	isolated filum lipoma	A rare dysraphic abnormality characterized by the infiltration of fatty tissue localized in the filum terminale, thickens and loses its flexibility, with normal conus shape, regardless of conus level.

MONDO:0958348	retained medullary cord	A rare closed dysraphism with terminal stalk characterized by persistant rudimentary spinal cord below conus. It contains non-functional neural tissue and is typically isolated. The diagnostic is suggested by attenuated conus without fat, further confirmed by pathological analysis (glioneuronal core with ependyma-lined lumen, nerve roots, and dorsal root ganglia). Differential diagnostic with intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring is mandatory as neuroimaging fails to distinguish it from functional conus.		
MONDO:0958349	dorsal spinal cord lipoma	A rare lipomatous, dysraphic malformation characterized by attachment to the dorsal surface of the spinal cord but not extending to the conus. It can be associated with others features such as a stalk and vertebral bone abnormalities.

Hemicords can be in a single dural sac or in two separated dural sacs. Other spinal cord malformations can be associated. Due to the comparable prognosis it is considered as a subtype of myeloschisis.		
MONDO:0958352	true myeloschisis	A rare open neural tube defect characterized by no other malformation than myeloschisis (spina bifida with a neural placode exposed at or below the skin plane and Chiari II malformation).
