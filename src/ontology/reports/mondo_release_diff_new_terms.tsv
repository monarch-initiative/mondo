MONDO:0100158	CHRNG-associated hypo-akinesia disorder of prenatal onset	A spectrum of presentations resulting from biallelic protein-altering variation in CHRNG. Inactivation of the receptor during early development leads to prenatal hypo-akinesia; subsequent phenotypes are a consequence of this hypo-akinesia and are thought to be dependent upon timing and severity of the anomaly at the neuromuscular junction. A range of phenotypes varying in severity (including both lethal and non-lethal presentations) have been reported, but typically include joint contractures, pterygia, dysmorphic features, vertebral and thoracic anomalies, and additional variable abnormalities. There are no clear genotype-phenotype correlations between the lethal and non-lethal presentations of this spectrum; both inter- and intra-familial variability have been reported, with the same variants being observed in both lethal and non-lethal cases.		
MONDO:0100190	gastric intestinal metaplasia	Metaplastic changes in the lining of the upper digestive tract.		
MONDO:0100208	self-limited familial neonatal-infantile epilepsy	An epilepsy syndrome associated with infantile period seizures, complete or nearly-complete seizure remission afterwards, usually good developmental outcome, and dominant transmission with high penetrance in pedigrees. For most affected infants, seizures begin within the first week after term birth. In a minority, however, seizures can begin after the first week but within the first several months of life. At onset, seizures may be highly recurrent, and often feature unilateral tonic limb stiffening that may alternate sides from seizure to seizure, accompanied by cyanosis and autonomic features. Limb shaking movements occur, but not in the evolving rhythmic pattern of tonic-clonic convulsions in older individuals. Neurological examination of the infant is normal between seizures. Although these seizures remit by 4-12 months of age in the majority, 15-30% of those affected have one or more seizure recurrences later, including febrile seizures, focal-onset seizures, and convulsions. Although most affected children show typical development, individuals with mild learning difficulties have been reported in families where the majority develop typically.		
MONDO:0100216	DICER1-related tumor predisposition	Pathogenic germline variation in DICER1 confers an autosomal dominant predisposition to tumor formation at multiple primary sites, including pleuropulmonary blastoma, pulmonary cysts, thyroid gland neoplasia, ovarian tumors, and cystic nephroma. Other syndromic features such as macrocephaly have been described.		
MONDO:0100227	ALS2-related motor neuron disease	Any motor neuron disease in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the ALS2 gene.		
MONDO:0100235	FOXC1-related anterior segment dysgenesis	Any anterior segment dysgenesis in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the FOXC1 gene.		
MONDO:0100236	LTBP2-related ocular dysgenesis	Any ocular dysgenesis disorder in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the LTBP2 gene.		
MONDO:0100254	CACNA1A-related complex neurodevelopmental disorder	A progressive complex neurodevelopmental condition caused by variants in the CACNA1A gene. Phenotypic onset (usually) occurs around age 1 and most often includes intellectual disability but can also include epileptic encephalopathy, benign paroxysmal torticollis of infancy and paroxysmal tonic upgaze psychomotor delay, learning difficulties, absence epilepsy, episodic ataxia, and hemiplegic migraines.		
MONDO:0700046	baclofen withdrawal syndrome	Withdrawal syndrome involving the abrupt discontinuation of baclofen therapy (intrathecal or oral). Baclofen withdrawal syndrome can result in high fever, altered mental status (including agitation, insomnia, confusion, delusions, hallucinations, seizures, visual changes, or psychosis), and potentially profound muscular rigidity that sometimes progresses to fatal rhabdomyolysis.		
MONDO:0700047	premenopausal osteoporosis	Osteoporosis occuring in premenopausal women with existing fragility fractures, diseases or treatments known to cause bone loss or fractures.		
MONDO:0700048	hand-foot syndrome	A condition characterized by redness, pain, swelling, and tingling in the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. It may appear as a side effect to chemotherapy agents.		
MONDO:0800436	craniofacial dysmorphism, skeletal anomalies, and impaired intellectual development 1	Any craniofacial dysmorphism, skeletal anomalies, and impaired intellectual development in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the TMCO1 gene.		
MONDO:0800437	Carey-Fineman-Ziter syndrome 1	A rare condition characterized by the association of hypotonia, Moebius sequence (bilateral congenital facial palsy with impairment of ocular abduction), Pierre-Robin sequence (micrognathia, glossoptosis, and high-arched or cleft palate), unusual face, and growth delay.		
MONDO:0800438	developmental delay with short stature, dysmorphic facial features, and sparse hair 1	Any developmental delay with short stature, dysmorphic facial features, and sparse hair in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the DPH1 gene.
