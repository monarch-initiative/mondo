MONDO:0100539	hemiplegic migraine-developmental and epileptic encephalopathy spectrum	A spectrum in which individuals may present with phenotypes ranging from hemiplegic migraines without epilepsy to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with or without episodic hemiplegia or other forms of paresis. Symptoms and severity may vary within families.		
MONDO:0100540	GATA6-related congenital heart disease with or without pancreatic agenesis or neonatal diabetes	A congenital heart disease that is present at birth. Representative examples include atrial septal defect 9, conotruncal heart malformations, tetralogy of Fallot, ventricular septal defect, atrioventricular septal defect, bicuspid aortic valve, transposition of the great arteries, persistent truncus arteriosus, congenital heart disease with pancreatic agenesis, and congenital heart disease with neonatal diabetes.		
MONDO:0100541	GATA5-related congenital heart defects	A congenital heart disease that is present at birth. Representative examples include tetralogy of fallot, bicuspid aortic valve, atrial septal defect, double outlet right ventricle, ventricular septal defect, and coarctation of the aorta, and atrioventricular canal.		
MONDO:0100542	clonal hematopoiesis	A precancerous condition characterized by cellular proliferation of hematopoietic cells where a substantial proportion of the cells are derived from a single hematopoietic stem cell lineage.		
MONDO:0100543	clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential	A precancerous condition characterized by the presence of somatic mutations in bone marrow or peripheral blood cells in individuals who may be cytopenic but do not have morphologic evidence of hematologic neoplasia. Its prevalence rises with age and is found in approximately 10% of individuals aged 70 to 80. It is associated with an increased risk of hematologic neoplasia. Mutations in the DNMT3A, TET2, or ASXL1 genes are usually identified. Approximately 10%-40% of individuals with age-related clonal hematopoiesis will progress to meet the diagnostic criteria for clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential.		
MONDO:0100544	age-related clonal hematopoiesis	A precancerous condition characterized by the gradual, clonal expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells carrying specific, disruptive, and recurrent genetic variants, in individuals without clear diagnosis of hematological malignancies. It is associated with an increased risk of developing hematologic cancers.		
MONDO:0100545	hereditary neurological disease	A heterogeneous group of genetic conditions with Mendelian (autosomal dominant, recessive, or X-linked) or chromosomal etiology characterized by abnormalities in the brain, spinal cord, nerves, or muscles.		
MONDO:0100546	hereditary neuromuscular disease	A heterogeneous group of genetic conditions with Mendelian (autosomal dominant, recessive, or X-linked) or chromosomal etiology that is characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness.		
MONDO:0100547	cardiogenetic disease	A heterogeneous group of genetic conditions, with Mendelian (autosomal dominant, recessive, or X-linked) or chromosomal etiology that are characterized by abnormalities in the cardiovascular system.		
MONDO:0100548	SERAC1-related neurological disorder	Any neurological disorder in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the SERAC1 gene.		
MONDO:0100549	focal nodular hyperplasia	A benign tumor of the liver, characterized by hyperplastic growth of hepatocytes and a central fibrovascular scar.		
MONDO:0100550	orbital myositis	A rare form of myositis that affects only the orbital muscles.		
MONDO:0800453	juvenile absence epilepsy	A genetic epilepsy with onset occurring around puberty. Juvenile absence epilepsy is characterized by sporadic occurrence of absence seizures, frequently associated with a long-life prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and sporadic myoclonic jerks.

MONDO:0958091	cleft palate-congenital heart defect-intellectual disability syndrome			
MONDO:0958094	adult-onset progressive leukoencephalopathy-early-onset deafness	A rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by congenital or early-onset sensorineural deafness and adult-onset progressive leukoencephalopathy. Progressive cognitive impairment and behavioral abnormalities are observed in the second or third decade of life, sometimes preceded by mild developmental delay and learning difficulties. Visual impairment in adult age has been reported. No central nervous system calcification is reported.

MONDO:0958110	atrophic papulosis			
MONDO:0958115	autosomal recessive combined immunodeficiency due to complete IL6ST deficiency			
MONDO:0958116	autosomal recessive combined immunodeficiency due to partial IL6ST deficiency

MONDO:0958118	autosomal recessive combined immunodeficiency due to IL6R deficiency			
MONDO:0958119	embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes	A rare central nervous system embryonal tumor characterized by embryonal cells arranged in multilayered rosettes and displaying one of three morphological patterns: embryonal tumor with abundant neuropil and true rosettes, ependymoblastoma, or medulloepithelioma. The tumors typically have a C19MC alteration or (rarely) a DICER1 mutation and correspond to WHO grade IV. They are mostly localized intracranially, rarely in the spinal cord, and commonly cause signs and symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure, sometimes seizures and focal neurological signs. Most cases occur in children during the first two years of life.
