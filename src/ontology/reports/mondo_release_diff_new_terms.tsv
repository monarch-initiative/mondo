MONDO:0700307	spastic paraplegia 30A, autosomal dominant			
MONDO:0700309	spastic paraplegia 18b, autosomal recessive			
MONDO:0700382	HMBS-related hepatic porphyria	A hepatic porphyria caused by monoallelic and biallelic variants in HMBS and presenting as a spectrum of disease (a semidominant inheritance pattern). Monoallelic variants predispose to acute/episodic attacks in adulthood with abdominal pain, neuropathy, and neuropsychiatric symptoms (women are more often affected) without cutaneous manifestations. Triggers precipitating acute attacks include estrogen/progesterone, oral contraceptives, alcohol, drugs, stress, or infections. Biallelic variants cause severe disease in childhood presenting with neurological issues including developmental abnormalities, ataxia, dysarthria, leukoencephalopathy, cataracts and optic nerve hypoplasia.		
MONDO:0700383	PPOX-related hepatic porphyria	A hepatic porphyria (or variegate porphyria) caused by monoallelic and biallelic variants in PPOX, presenting as a spectrum of disease (a semidominant inheritance pattern). Cases caused by monoallelic variants may have onset during adolescence or adulthood and are episodic characterized by abdominal pain, constipation, vomiting, muscular paralysis, and psychosis. Other symptoms may include abnormal blistering of the skin, cutaneous photosensitivity, and neuropathy. Triggers precipitating acute attacks include estrogen/progesterone, oral contraceptives, alcohol, drugs, stress, or infections. Cases caused by biallelic variants, which reduce enzyme activity to <25% of normal, typically result in child or adolescent onset with greater severity. Symptoms for this extend to brachydactyly, clinodactyly, intellectual disability, nystagmus, myopia, growth retardation, and hyperpigmentation.		
MONDO:0700384	porphyria, acute intermittent, nonerythroid variant	A HMBS-related hepatic porphyria subtype caused by variants in HMBS exon 1, which is not expressed in erythrocytes, causing HMBS activity in erythrocytes to be at a normal level. The housekeeping promoter produces the HMBS transcript containing exons 1 and 3-15. In contrast, erythrocytes use an erythroid-specific promoter downstream of the housekeeping HMBS promoter to produce a transcript that contains only exons 2-15. Therefore deleterious variants occurring within exon 1 or affecting the splicing of exon 1 to exon 3 do not impact the erythrocyte isozyme, but do impact the more broadly expressed housekeeping isozyme.

MONDO:0700416	paraneoplastic sensory ganglionopathy			
MONDO:0700418	idiopathic hypercalciuria	A rare renal disease characterized by persistent excess urinary calcium excretion in the absence of an underlying systemic disease and hypercalcemia. The condition leads to an increased risk for the formation of kidney stones and nephrocalcinosis, as well as reduced bone mineral density with increased incidence of fractures in some patients.		
MONDO:0700419	semilobar holoprosencephaly	A form of holoprosencephaly characterized by fusion of the left and right frontal and parietal lobes with only a posterior interhemispheric fissure. Craniofacial features variably include ocular hypotelorism, midline cleft lip (complete or partial) and a flat nose.		
MONDO:0700424	prenatal benign hypophosphatasia	A very rare form of hypophosphatasia characterized by prenatal skeletal manifestations (limb shortening and bowing) that slowly resolve spontaneously and later may develop into the moderate childhood or adult forms of the disease.		
MONDO:0700428	hypomyelination neuropathy-arthrogryposis syndrome	A rare, genetic, limb malformation syndrome characterized by multiple congenital distal joint contractures (incl. talipes equinovarus and both proximal and distal interphalangeal joint contractures of the hands) and very severe motor paralysis at birth (i.e. lack of swallowing, autonomous respiratory function and deep tendon reflexes), leading to death within first 3 months of life. Fetal hypo- or akinesia, late-onset polyhydramnios and dramatically reduced, or absent, motor nerve conduction velocities (<10 m/s) are frequently associated. Nerve ultrastructural morphology shows severe abnormalities of the nodes of Ranvier and myelinated axons.		
MONDO:0700447	anterior urethral valve	A rare, congenital, fetal lower urinary tract obstruction (LUTO) anomaly occurring in males and characterized by a posteriorly directed semilunar fold arising from the floor of the anterior urethra and causing urethral obstruction during micturition. The valves may be located anywhere distal to the membranous urethra. Clinical presentation is highly variable, depending on age and degree of urinary obstruction, and includes urinary incontinence, urinary retention, weak urinary stream, post-micturitional dribbling, bulging on the ventral penis, urinary tract infection, and urosepsis.		
MONDO:0700463	congenital trochlear nerve palsy	A rare ophthalmic disorder with cranial nerve involvement characterized by dysfunction of the superior oblique muscle with typical eye motility patterns including elevation in adduction, V-pattern related to reduced abduction force in downgaze with unopposed adduction by the inferior rectus muscle, and excyclotorsion. Patients may present with contralateral head tilt to compensate for vertical binocular misalignment and diplopia.		
MONDO:0700466	presynaptic congenital myasthenic syndrome			
MONDO:0700478	resistance to thyroid hormone due to a mutation in thyroid hormone receptor beta	A rare genetic hyperthyroidism characterized by elevated levels of circulating free thyroid hormones, normal or elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone, decreased peripheral tissue responses to iodothyronine action, and a highly variable clinical phenotype which most commonly includes goiter, resting tachycardia, osteoporosis, short stature, and attention deficit disorder. Some patients may be entirely asymptomatic.		
MONDO:0700479	mirror-image polydactyly	A rare non-syndromic limb malformation characterized by a hand or foot with more than five digits that has a recognizable anterior/posterior axis of symmetry, either with a hallux- or thumb-like structure or an interdigital space in the middle. The most lateral digits on each side typically resemble fifth fingers or toes. The malformation may be unilateral or bilateral and may occur in isolation or in association with other congenital anomalies.		
MONDO:0700513	apolipoprotein A-I deficiency	A lipoprotein metabolism disorder characterized biochemically by complete absence of apolipoprotein AI and extremely low plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and clinically by corneal opacities and xanthomas complicated with premature coronary heart disease (CHD).
