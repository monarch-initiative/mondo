MONDO:0100533	hemorrhage, intracerebral, susceptibility to	An inherited susceptibility or predisposition to developing intracerebral hemorrhage.		
MONDO:0100534	SMARCB1-deficient kidney medullary carcinoma	A high-grade carcinoma that arises from the renal medulla and is characterized by inactivation of the SMARCB1 gene. It affects children and adults and occurs mainly in patients with sickle cell trait. The majority of the cases occur in the right kidney.

MONDO:0100539	hemiplegic migraine-developmental and epileptic encephalopathy spectrum	A spectrum in which individuals may present with phenotypes ranging from hemiplegic migraines without epilepsy to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with or without episodic hemiplegia or other forms of paresis. Symptoms and severity may vary within families.		
MONDO:0100540	GATA6-related congenital heart disease with or without pancreatic agenesis or neonatal diabetes	A congenital heart disease that is present at birth. Representative examples include atrial septal defect 9, conotruncal heart malformations, tetralogy of Fallot, ventricular septal defect, atrioventricular septal defect, bicuspid aortic valve, transposition of the great arteries, persistent truncus arteriosus, congenital heart disease with pancreatic agenesis, and congenital heart disease with neonatal diabetes.		
MONDO:0100541	GATA5-related congenital heart defects	A congenital heart disease that is present at birth. Representative examples include tetralogy of fallot, bicuspid aortic valve, atrial septal defect, double outlet right ventricle, ventricular septal defect, and coarctation of the aorta, and atrioventricular canal.		
MONDO:0100542	clonal hematopoiesis	A precancerous condition characterized by cellular proliferation of hematopoietic cells where a substantial proportion of the cells are derived from a single hematopoietic stem cell lineage.		
MONDO:0100543	clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential	A precancerous condition characterized by the presence of somatic mutations in bone marrow or peripheral blood cells in individuals who may be cytopenic but do not have morphologic evidence of hematologic neoplasia. Its prevalence rises with age and is found in approximately 10% of individuals aged 70 to 80. It is associated with an increased risk of hematologic neoplasia. Mutations in the DNMT3A, TET2, or ASXL1 genes are usually identified. Approximately 10%-40% of individuals with age-related clonal hematopoiesis will progress to meet the diagnostic criteria for clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential.		
MONDO:0100544	age-related clonal hematopoiesis	A precancerous condition characterized by the gradual, clonal expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells carrying specific, disruptive, and recurrent genetic variants, in individuals without clear diagnosis of hematological malignancies. It is associated with an increased risk of developing hematologic cancers.		
MONDO:0100545	hereditary neurological disease	A heterogeneous group of genetic conditions with Mendelian (autosomal dominant, recessive, or X-linked) or chromosomal etiology characterized by abnormalities in the brain, spinal cord, nerves, or muscles.		
MONDO:0100546	hereditary neuromuscular disease	A heterogeneous group of genetic conditions with Mendelian (autosomal dominant, recessive, or X-linked) or chromosomal etiology that is characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness.		
MONDO:0100547	cardiogenetic disease	A heterogeneous group of genetic conditions, with Mendelian (autosomal dominant, recessive, or X-linked) or chromosomal etiology that are characterized by abnormalities in the cardiovascular system.		
MONDO:0100548	SERAC1-related neurological disorder	Any neurological disorder in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the SERAC1 gene.		
MONDO:0700246	ocular dysgenesis caused by defects in PAX6 regulation	Any eye disorder in which the cause of the disease is a variant in the PAX6 gene itself or a variant within another locus that results in defective regulation of the PAX6 gene.		
MONDO:0700247	RAB18 deficiency	Group of diseases encompassing a spectrum of disorders characterized by Warburg Micro Syndrome (characterized by eye, nervous system, and endocrine abnormalities) and Martsolf Syndrome phenotypes (characterized by similar – but milder – findings). To date Warburg micro syndrome comprises >96% of reported individuals with genetically defined RAB18 deficiency. The hallmark ophthalmologic findings are bilateral congenital cataracts, usually accompanied by microphthalmia, microcornea (diameter <10), and small atonic pupils. Poor vision despite early cataract surgery likely results from progressive optic atrophy and cortical visual impairment. Individuals with Warburg micro syndrome have severe to profound intellectual disability (ID); those with Martsolf syndrome have mild to moderate ID. Some individuals with RAB18 deficiency also have epilepsy. In Warburg micro syndrome, a progressive ascending spastic paraplegia typically begins with spastic diplegia and contractures during the first year, followed by upper-limb involvement leading to spastic quadriplegia after about age five years, often eventually causing breathing difficulties. In Martsolf syndrome infantile hypotonia is followed primarily by slowly progressive lower-limb spasticity. Hypogonadism – when present – manifests in both syndromes, in males as micropenis and/or cryptorchidism and in females as hypoplastic labia minora, clitoral hypoplasia, and small introitus.		
MONDO:0800451	congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia			
MONDO:0800452	congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia 1	A rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the MPL gene. It is characterized by an isolated and severe decrease in the number of platelets and megakaryocytes during the first years of life that develops into bone marrow failure with pancytopenia later in childhood.
