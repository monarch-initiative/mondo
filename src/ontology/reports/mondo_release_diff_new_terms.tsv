MONDO:0700350	GRIN2B-related complex neurodevelopmental disorder	A complex neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a variation in the GRIN2B gene		
MONDO:1060144	retinitis pigmentosa 7, digenic	A digenic form of retinitis pigmentosa resulting from a mutation in the PRPH2 gene and a null mutation of the ROM1 gene, leading to progressive degeneration of the retina and vision loss.		
MONDO:1060145	Leber congenital amaurosis 18	A Leber congenital amaurosis that is caused by a variation in the PRPH2 gene.		
MONDO:1060146	FGFR1-related Pfeiffer syndrome	Any Pfeiffer syndrome in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the FGFR1 gene.		
MONDO:1060147	FGFR2-related Pfeiffer syndrome	Any Pfeiffer syndrome in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the FGFR2 gene.		
MONDO:1060148	empty nose syndrome	A rare iatrogenic disease characterized by paradoxical nasal obstruction and symptoms including air hunger and suffocation-like breathing sensation, nasal dryness and crusting, burning pain or cold airflow sensation, impaired sleep and cognitive function and severe anxiety and depression, and typically occurs after surgical reduction or removal of nasal turbinates.		
MONDO:1060149	ACAN-related short stature spectrum	A rare semidominant genetic skeletal disorder caused by a variation in ACAN gene, characterized by short stature with variable phenotypic features which may include osteochondritis dissecans, advanced bone age, early-onset arthritis, and/or features consistent with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, Kimberley type caused by a single allele whereas biallelic variation can cause spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, aggrecan type.		
MONDO:1060150	NOTCH1-related AOS spectrum disorder	A disease characterized by a spectrum of cardiac and extracardiac phenotypes caused by a disease-causing variant in the NOTCH1 gene, inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Affected individuals may present with congenital heart defects, bicuspid aortic valve, aortic valve stenosis, thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection, anomalies in brain structure, intracranial or posterior circulation vascular anomalies, cutaneous vascular malformations, cutis marmorata, and/or a phenotype compatible with Adams-Oliver syndrome (i.e. cutis aplasia, terminal limb defects, skull ossification defects).		
MONDO:1060151	schizoaffective bipolar disorder	A schizoaffective disorder marked by episodes of hypomania or mania and sometimes major depression.		
MONDO:1060152	schizoaffective depressive disorder	A schizoaffective disorder marked by episodes of only major depression.		
MONDO:1060153	multiple symmetric lipomatosis with partial lipodystrophy	A form of multiple symmetric lipomatosis accompanied by partial lipodystrophy (loss of subcutaneous fat in other regions), with or without peripheral neuropathy. Nearly all reported cases have been observed in individuals who are homozygous for the p.Arg707Trp variant in the MFN2 gene.		
MONDO:1060154	INTU-related skeletal ciliopathy	A skeletal ciliopathy caused by a mutation in INTU gene and is characterized by facial dysmorphism, tongue nodules, developmental delay, and polydactyly. Some individuals may also present with short stature, or other variable syndromic findings.
