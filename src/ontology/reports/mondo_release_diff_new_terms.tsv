MONDO:0100524	ASAH1-related sphingolipidosis	A spectrum of disorders that includes Farber disease and spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy. Both disorders are caused by mutations in the ASAH1 gene that encodes the lysosomal hydrolase that breaks down the bioactive lipid, ceramide.		
MONDO:0100525	TCF7L2-related neurodevelopmental disorder	A newly discovered disorder caused by a change (variant or mutation) in the TCF7L2 gene. This mutation may be responsible for developmental delays in childhood, intellectual disability, autism, myopia, ADHD, abnormal physical features and other problems. There is a wide spectrum of severity for individuals affected with TRND. Many of the symptoms of TRND overlap with other neurodevelopmental disorders. TRND must be diagnosed with a genetic test and cannot be diagnosed by symptoms alone.

MONDO:0100528	Hao-Fountain syndrome due to 16p13.2 microdeletion	A partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 16 characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech delay, autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, hypogonadism, and hypotonia. The behavioral profile includes impulsivity, compulsivity, stubbornness, manipulative behaviors, temper tantrums, and aggressive behaviors.		
MONDO:0800448	leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter	"A new leukoencephalopathy, the CACH syndrome (Childhood Ataxia with Central nervous system Hypomyelination) or VWM (Vanishing White Matter) was identified on clinical and MRI criteria. Classically, this disease is characterized by (1) an onset between 2 and 5 years of age, with a cerebello-spastic syndrome exacerbated by episodes of fever or head trauma leading to death after 5 to 10 years of disease evolution, (2) a diffuse involvement of the white matter on cerebral MRI with a CSF-like signal intensity (cavitation), (3) a recessive autosomal mode of inheritance, (4) neuropathologic findings consistent with a cavitating orthochromatic leukodystrophy with increased number of oligodendrocytes with sometimes \foamy'' aspect."""
