MONDO:0012017	definition	Parkes Weber syndrome (PWS) is a rare congenital condition characterized by a large number of abnormal blood vessels.The main signs and symptoms of PWS typically include a capillary malformation on the skin; hypertrophy (excessive growth) ofthe bone and soft tissue of the affected limb; and multiple arteriovenousfistulas (abnormal connections between arteries and veins) which canpotentially lead to heart failure. There also may be pain in the affected limb and a difference in size between the limbs. Some cases of Parkes Weber syndrome result from mutations inthe RASA1 gene, andare inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In these cases, affected people usually have multiple capillary malformations. People with PWS without multiple capillary malformations are unlikely to have mutations in the RASA1 gene; in these cases, the cause of the condition is often unknown. Management typically depends on the presence and severity of symptoms and may includeembolization or surgery in the affected limb.
