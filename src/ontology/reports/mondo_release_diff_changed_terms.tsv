MONDO:0000437	definition	A neurological syndrome characterised by clumsy and unco-ordinated movement of the limbs, trunk, and cranial muscles. It results from pathology in the cerebellum and its connections, or in the proprioceptive sensory pathways.	A neurological syndrome characterised by clumsy and uncoordinated movement of the limbs, trunk, and cranial muscles. It results from pathology in the cerebellum and its connections, or in the proprioceptive sensory pathways.
MONDO:0001324	definition	A condition caused by the excessive secretion of androgens from the adrenal cortex; the ovaries; or the testes. The clinical significance in males is negligible. In women, the common manifestations are hirsutism and virilism as seen in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome and adrenocortical hyperfunction.	OBSOLETE. A condition caused by the excessive secretion of androgens from the adrenal cortex; the ovaries; or the testes. The clinical significance in males is negligible. In women, the common manifestations are hirsutism and virilism as seen in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome and adrenocortical hyperfunction.

MONDO:0007842	definition	Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, type 11, is characterised by generalized joint hypermobility often complicated by dislocation of major joints, particularly the shoulder but in some cases the kneecap. Congenital hip dislocation has also been frequently reported. The syndrome has been described in several families. It is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait, with high penetrance.	A type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome characterised by generalized joint hypermobility often complicated by dislocation of major joints, particularly the shoulder but in some cases the kneecap. Congenital hip dislocation has also been frequently reported. The syndrome has been described in several families. It is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait, with high penetrance.
MONDO:0008332	definition	Platelet type Von Willebrand disease (PT-VWD) is a bleeding disorder characterized by mild to moderate mucocutaneous bleeding, which becomes more pronounced during pregnancy or following ingestion of drugs that have anti-platelet activity. PT-VWD is due to hyperresponsive platelets, resulting in thrombocytopenia.

PT-VWD is due to hyperresponsive platelets, resulting in thrombocytopenia.
MONDO:0015924	definition	Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a group of diseases characterized by elevated pulmonary arterial resistance leading to right heart failure. PAH is progressive and potentially fatal. PAH may be idiopathic and/ or familial, or induced by drug or toxin (drug-or toxin-induced PAH) or associated with other diseases like congenital heart disease, connective tissue disease, HIV, schistosomiasis, portal hypertension (PAH associated with other disease).	A group of diseases characterized by elevated pulmonary arterial resistance leading to right heart failure. PAH is progressive and potentially fatal.

MONDO:0017905	definition	X-linked (XR) Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD) describes a rare group of immunodeficiencies due to specific mutations in the inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells, kinase gamma (IKBKG) or the cytochrome b-245, beta polypeptide (CYBB) genes. They are characterized by mycobacterial infections, occuring in males.	A rare group of immunodeficiencies due to specific mutations in the inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells, kinase gamma (IKBKG) or the cytochrome b-245, beta polypeptide (CYBB) genes.

MONDO:0012357	definition	Any open-angle glaucoma in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the WDR36 gene.	OBSOLETE. Any open-angle glaucoma in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the WDR36 gene.
MONDO:0013920	definition	Any herpes simplex encephalitis in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the TRAF3 gene.	A Mendelian susceptibility or predisposition to herpes simplex infection induced encephalitis in which the cause of the diseas is a mutation in the TRAF3 gene.
MONDO:0013921	definition	Any herpes simplex encephalitis in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the TICAM1 gene.	A Mendelian susceptibility or predisposition to herpes simplex infection induced encephalitis in which the cause of the diseas is a mutation in the TICAM1 gene.

MONDO:0100153	definition	A nervous system disorder characterized by complex cortical malformations including in most cases dysmorphic basal ganglia in which the cause of the disease is a variation in one or more of the tubulin genes.	A nervous system disorder characterized by complex cortical malformations including in most cases dysmorphic basal ganglia and/or corpus callosum in which the cause of the disease is a variation in a tubulin gene.
MONDO:0024563	definition	Any herpes simplex encephalitis in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the UNC93B1 gene.	A Mendelian susceptibility or predisposition to herpes simplex infection induced encephalitis in which the cause of the diseas is a mutation in the UNC93B1 gene.
