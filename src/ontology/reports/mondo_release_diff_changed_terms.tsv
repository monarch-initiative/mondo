MONDO:0005775	definition	An X-linked genetic condition caused by alterations in the gene G6PD that result in moderately to severely decreased activity levels of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.

MONDO:0009868	definition	Glycogen storage disease (GSD) due to liver and muscle phosphorylase kinase (PhK) deficiency is a benign inborn error of glycogen metabolism. It is the mildest form of GSD due to PhK deficiency.	A disorder of glycogen metabolism caused by a deficiency in liver and muscle phosphorylase kinase subunit b, is autosomal recessive and can lead to hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia after prolonged fasting, and growth retardation.
MONDO:0017771	definition	Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome describes a spectrum of Mullerian duct anomalies characterized by congenital aplasia of the uterus and upper 2/3 of the vagina in otherwise phenotypically normal females. It can be classified as either MRKH syndrome type 1 (corresponding to isolated utero-vaginal aplasia) or MRKH syndrome type 2 (utero-vaginal aplasia associated with other malformations).	Spectrum of Mullerian duct anomalies characterized by congenital aplasia of the uterus and upper 2/3 of the vagina in otherwise phenotypically normal females. It can be classified as either MRKH syndrome type 1 (corresponding to isolated utero-vaginal aplasia) or MRKH syndrome type 2 (utero-vaginal aplasia associated with other malformations).

MONDO:0014855	definition	Any autosomal dominant non-syndromic intellectual disability in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the GNB1 gene.	Any autosomal dominant non-syndromic intellectual disability in which the cause of the disease is a heterozygous mutation in the GNB1 gene.
