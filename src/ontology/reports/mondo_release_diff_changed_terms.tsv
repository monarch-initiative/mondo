MONDO:0019696	definition	Acromesomelic dysplasia describes a group of extremely rare, inherited, progressive skeletal conditions that result in a particular form of short stature, called short-limb dwarfism. The short stature is the result of unusually short forearms and forelegs (mesomelia) and abnormal shortening of the bones in the hands and feet (acromelia). At birth, the hands and feet may appear abnormally short and broad. Over time, the apparent disproportion becomes even more obvious, especially during the first years of life. Additional features may include: limited extension of the elbows and arms; progressive abnormal curvature of the spine; an enlarged head; and a slightly flattened midface. Acromesomelic dysplasia is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. There are different types of acromesomelic dysplasia, which are distinguished by their genetic cause.

Acromesomelic dysplasia, Maroteaux type Acromesomelic dysplasia, Hunter-Thompson type Acromesomelic dysplasia, Grebe type	A group of extremely rare, inherited, progressive skeletal conditions that result in a particular form of short stature, called short-limb dwarfism. The short stature is the result of unusually short forearms and forelegs (mesomelia) and abnormal shortening of the bones in the hands and feet (acromelia). At birth, the hands and feet may appear abnormally short and broad. Over time, the apparent disproportion becomes even more obvious, especially during the first years of life. Additional features may include: limited extension of the elbows and arms; progressive abnormal curvature of the spine; an enlarged head; and a slightly flattened midface.

MONDO:0044219	definition	The Duffy blood group system, which consists of 4 alleles, 5 phenotypes, and 5 antigens, is important in clinical medicine because of transfusion incompatibilities and hemolytic disease of the newborn. Duffy antigens are located on ACKR1 (OMIM:613665), or DARC, an acidic glycoprotein found on erythrocytes and other cells throughout the body. The 2 principal antigens, Fy(a) and Fy(b), are produced by the FYA and FYB codominant alleles (see {613665.0001}). Four phenotypes are defined by the corresponding antibodies, anti-Fy(a) and anti-Fy(b): Fy(a+b-), Fy(a-b+), Fy(a+b+), and Fy(a-b-). Fy(a-b-), or Duffy null, is the major phenotype in African and American blacks and is characterized by the presence of Fy(b) on nonerythroid cells, but an absence of Fy(b) on erythrocytes. The Fy(a-b-) phenotype is associated with complete resistance to infection by the malarial parasite Plasmodium vivax (see OMIM:611162). Individuals with the Fy(a-b-) phenotype have the FYB-erythroid silent (FYB-ES) allele with a mutation in the DARC promoter ({613665.0002}).

The SHEP2 association (OMIM:266300) is determined by variation at the MC1R locus (OMIM:155555) and describes a phenotype predominantly characterized by red hair and fair skin. SHEP3 (OMIM:601800) encompasses pigment variation influenced by the TYR gene (OMIM:606933); SHEP4 (OMIM:113750), that influenced by the SLC24A5 gene (OMIM:609802). Variation in the SLC45A2 (OMIM:606202) and SLC24A4 (OMIM:609840) genes result in the phenotypic associations SHEP5 (OMIM:227240) and SHEP6 (OMIM:210750), respectively. Sequence variation thought to affect expression of KITLG (OMIM:184745) results in the SHEP7 (OMIM:611664) phenotypic association.

MONDO:0044257	definition	Autosomal recessive inheritance of the Lutheran null blood group phenotype is extremely rare, and has been reported in only 5 individuals. There is no obvious associated clinical or hematologic pathology, and all patients have been identified through identification of anti-Lu3 antibodies in their serum ({4:Karamatic Crew et al., 2007}).nnThe Lutheran inhibitor blood group phenotype (In(Lu); OMIM:111150) is characterized phenotypically by the apparent absence of the Lu antigen on red blood cells during serologic tests, i.e. Lu(a-b-). Since it is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, it was initially postulated to result from an inhibitor of the Lu antigen. However, {7:Singleton et al. (2008)} found that the phenotype results from a mutation in the transcription factor KLF1 that regulates expression of the BCAM gene. These 2 forms of Lutheran absence on red blood cells can be differentiated both by the pedigree and by serologic studies.nnAn X-linked recessive form (OMIM:309050) has been rarely reported.	OBSOLETE.

MONDO:0044259	definition	Two types of melanin, the red pheomelanin and the black eumelanin, are present in human skin. {22:Valverde et al. (1995)} noted that eumelanin is photoprotective, whereas pheomelanin may contribute to UV-induced skin damage because of its potential to generate free radicals in response to ultraviolet radiation. Individuals with red hair have a predominance of pheomelanin in hair and skin and/or a reduced ability to produce eumelanin, which may explain why they fail to tan and are at risk from ultraviolet radiation. In mammals, the relative proportions of pheomelanin and eumelanin are regulated by melanocyte-stimulating hormone (see OMIM:176830), which acts via its receptor (MC1R) on melanocytes to increase the synthesis of eumelanin, and also via the product of the agouti locus (AGTI; OMIM:600201), which antagonizes this action.
