MONDO:0017782	definition	Developmental and speech delay due to SOX5 deficiency is a rare genetic syndromic intellectual disability characterized by mild to severe global developmental delay, intellectual disability and behavioral abnormalities, hypotonia, strabismus, optic nerve hypoplasia and mild facial dysmorphic features (down slanting palpebral fissures, frontal bossing, crowded teeth, auricular abnormalities and prominent philtral ridges). Other associated clinical features may include seizures and skeletal anomalies (kyphosis/scoliosis, pectus deformities).

MONDO:0019409	definition	Idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis (IJO) is a primary condition of bone demineralization that presents with pain in the back and extremities, walking difficulties, multiple fractures, and radiological evidence of osteoporosis.	Idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis (IJO) is a primary condition of bone demineralization childhood or adolescence that presents with pain in the back and extremities, walking difficulties, multiple fractures, and radiological evidence of osteoporosis.

MONDO:0020306	definition	Tibial hemimelia-polysyndactyly-triphalangeal thumb syndrome is a rare, genetic dysostosis syndrome, with marked inter- and intra-familial variation, typically characterized by triphalangeal thumbs, hand and/or foot polysyndactyly and/or absent/hypoplastic tibiae (associated with duplication of fibulae in some cases), although isolated triphalangeal thumbs have also been reported. It is often accompanied with remarkable short stature and additional features may include radio-ulnar synostosis and hand oligodactyly, as well as abnormal carpal and metatarsal bones.
