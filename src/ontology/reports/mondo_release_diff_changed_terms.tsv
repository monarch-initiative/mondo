MONDO:0100035	definition	Structural epilepsies are conceptualized as having a distinct structural brain abnormality that has been demonstrated to be associated with a substantially increased risk of epilepsy in appropriately designed studies. The structural brain abnormality can be acquired (such as due to stroke, trauma or infection) or may be of genetic origin; however, as we currently understand it, the structural brain abnormality is a separate disorder interposed between the acquired or genetic defect and the epilepsy.

MONDO:0005579	definition	A chronic condition characterized by recurrent generalized seizures.	A generalised epilepsy that encompasses several common seizure phenotypes including childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone.

Seizure types include one or a combination of absence seizures, myoclonic seizures and/or generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
MONDO:0006748	definition	A variant of epilepsy characterized by continuous focal jerking of a body part over a period of hours, days, or even years without spreading to other body regions. Contractions may be aggravated by movement and are reduced, but not abolished during sleep. electroencephalography demonstrates epileptiform (spike and wave) discharges over the hemisphere opposite to the affected limb in most instances. The repetitive movements may originate from the cerebral cortex or from subcortical structures (e.g., brain stem; basal ganglia). This condition is associated with Russian Spring and Summer encephalitis (see encephalitis, tick borne); Rasmussen syndrome (see encephalitis); multiple sclerosis; diabetes mellitus; brain neoplasms; and cerebrovascular disorders. (From Brain, 1996 April;119(pt2):393-407; Epilepsia 1993;34;Suppl 1:S29-S36; and Adams et al., Principles of Neurology, 6th ed, p319)	A variant of epilepsy characterized by continuous focal jerking of a body part over a period of hours, days, or even years without spreading to other body regions.

MONDO:0007558	definition	Benign occipital epilepsy is a rare, genetic neurological disorder characterized by visual seizures and occipital epileptiform paroxysms reactive to ocular opening which present in infancy to mid-adolescence. Vomiting, tonic eye deviation and impairment of consciousness are typically associated with the Panayiotopoulos type, while visual hallucinations, ictal blindness and post-ictal headache are commonly observed in the Gastaut type. Electroencephalographic findings in both types are similar and include bilateral, synchronous, high voltage spike-wave complexes in a normal background activity located predominantly in the occipital lobes.

MONDO:0008759	definition	Oxoglutaric aciduria is a very rare tricarboxylic acid cycle disorder, resulting from a deficiency in alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (one of the three subunits of the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex), that most often presents in the neonatal period with hypotonia, severe encephalopathy, extrapyramidal signs, pyramidal tract dysfunction and seizures and that frequently results in death in early childhood.

MONDO:0019169	definition	Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency (PDHD) is a rare neurometabolic disorder characterized by a wide range of clinical signs with metabolic and neurological components of varying severity.

MONDO:0010595	definition	Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCO syndrome) is a cause of male infertility. In SCO syndrome, only Sertoli cells (cells that nurture the immature sperm) line the seminiferous tubules (tubes inside the testicles where sperm develop). Therefore, there are not any sperm cells present in the seminiferous tubules. Men typically learn they are affected between ages 20-40 years when being evaluated for infertility and are found to have no sperm production (azoospermia). Other signs and symptoms are rare, but in some cases there could be an underlying cause of SCO syndrome that causes other symptoms, such as Klinefelter syndrome. Most cases of SCO syndrome are idiopathic (of unknown cause), but causes may include deletions of genetic information on regions of the Y-chromosome, especially on the azoospermia factor (AZF) region of Y-chromosome. Other causes include exposure to chemicals or toxins, history of radiation therapy, and history of severe trauma. Diagnosis of SCO syndrome is confirmed with testicular biopsy. Although there is currently no effective treatment, assisted reproductive technology may assist some men with SCO syndrome in being able to have children.
