MONDO:0006051	definition	Pig disease caused by porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). Most representative symptoms include wasting, unthriftness, paleness of the skin, respiratory distress, diarrhea and sometimes icterus.	
MONDO:0009821	definition	Lethal osteosclerotic bone dysplasia is defined by generalized osteosclerosis with periosteal bone formation, characteristic facial dysmorphism, brain abnormalities including intracerebral calcifications, and neonatal lethal course.	Generalized osteosclerosis with periosteal bone formation, characteristic facial dysmorphism, brain abnormalities including intracerebral calcifications, and neonatal lethal course.
MONDO:0013730	definition	Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurs after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant and is a reaction of donor immune cells against host tissues. Activated donor T cells damage host epithelial cells after an inflammatory cascade that begins with the preparative regimen.	An immune system disorder that occurs after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant and is a reaction of donor immune cells against host tissues. Activated donor T cells damage host epithelial cells after an inflammatory cascade that begins with the preparative regimen.
MONDO:0020485	definition	King-Denborough syndrome is a rare genetic non-dystrophic myopathy characterized by the triad of congenital myopathy, dysmorphic features and susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia. Patients present with a wide phenotypic range, including delayed motor development, muscle weakness and fatigability, ptosis and facies myopathica (with or without creatine kinase elevations), skeletal abnormalities (e.g. short stature, scoliosis, kyphosis, lumbar lordosis and pectus carinatum/excavatum), mild dysmorphic facial features (e.g. hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, epicanthic folds, low set ears, micrognathia), webbing of the neck, cryptorchidism, and a susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia and/or rhabdomyolysis due to intensive physical strain, viral infection or statin use.
