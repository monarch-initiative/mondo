MONDO:0019369	definition	Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a rare neurologic disease painful progressive condition that corresponds to a group of disorders characterized by a disproportionate spontaneous or stimulus-induced pain, accompanied by a variably mixed myriad of autonomic and motor disorders including symptoms such as swelling, allodynia, skin blood supply and trophic disturbances. CRPS most often affects one of the arms, legs, hands, or feet and usually occurs after an injury or trauma to that limb.	A chronic pain syndrome characterized by a disproportionate spontaneous or stimulus-induced pain, accompanied by a variably mixed myriad of autonomic and motor disorders including symptoms such as swelling, allodynia, skin blood supply and trophic disturbances. CRPS most often affects one of the arms, legs, hands, or feet and usually occurs after an injury or trauma to that limb.
MONDO:0800180	definition	Any inherited porphyria in which the cause of the disease is monoallelic or biallelic variants in the CPOX gene.	A porphyria caused by monoallelic and biallelic variants in CPOX and presenting as a spectrum of disease (a semidominant inheritance pattern). Monoallelic variants typically cause acute/episodic neurovisceral attacks with adolescent or adult onset, characterized by severe abdominal pain as well as acute motor neuropathy and other neurological symptoms. Triggers precipitating acute attacks include estrogen/progesterone, oral contraceptives, alcohol, drugs, stress, or infections. Cases with biallelic variants have symptoms in infancy, including hemolytic anemia, enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), and severe jaundice. Additional symptoms may include erythrodontia, red urine, fragile skin, and cutaneous photosensitivity leading to scarring of sun-exposed skin.
MONDO:0100498	definition	Any inherited porphyria in which the cause of the disease is monoallelic or biallelic variants in the UROD gene.	Porphyria caused by monoallelic and biallelic variants in UROD and presenting as a spectrum of disease (a semidominant inheritance pattern). Additionally, environmental factors almost always play a role in the disease. Monoallelic variants when exacerbated by environmental factors can result in episodic adult onset of photosensitivity. Biallelic variants that reduce WT enzyme activity <20% cause childhood onset of photosensitivity and sometimes liver damage.
MONDO:0008319	definition	Erythropoietic protoporphyria caused by a compound heterozygous or homozygous mutation in the gene encoding ferrochelatase (FECH) on chromosome 18q21.	An erythropoietic protoporphyria caused by biallelic variants in FECH (an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern) and causing primarily accumulation of protoporphyrin IX. Symptoms include extremely painful photosensitivity in childhood, possible microcytic anemia, cholelithiasis, and ~5% of patients develop liver failure. The majority of individuals with FECH-related erythropoietic protoporphyria harbor a hypomorphic variant (NM_000140.5:c.315-48T>C), which reduces enzyme levels by ~35%, in trans to a second pathogenic variant. Clinically individuals with this form of porphyria cannot be distinguished from those with ALAS2-related erythropoietic protoporphyria.
MONDO:0009902	definition	Congenital erythropoietic porphyria, or Günther disease, is a form of erythropoietic porphyria characterized by very severe and mutilating photodermatosis.	An erythropoietic porphyria (massive accumulation of photoreactive porphyrins in the bone marrow erythroid cells and circulating erythrocytes, resulting in cutaneous photosensitivity) caused by biallelic variants in UROS (in an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern). Cases where biallelic variants reduce WT enzyme activity to <5% are characterized by photosensitivity, hemolytic anemia (often in utero), erythrodontia, splenomegaly, cutaneous blistering, scarring and disfigurement. Other cases where biallelic variants do not reduce enzyme activity as severely (5-12% of WT activity) have a later onset of photosensitivity and milder symptoms.
MONDO:1040039	definition	Any ciliopathy caused by monoallelic, biallelic, or hemizygous variants in the OFD1 gene.	Any ciliopathy caused by monoallelic, biallelic, or hemizygous variants in the OFD1 gene. This disease is characterized by a broad range of phenotypes including Joubert syndrome, orofaciodigital syndrome, retinitis pigmentosa, and primary ciliary dyskinesia.
MONDO:0010420	definition	X-linked form of erythropoietic protoporphyria.	An erythropoietic protoporphyria in which the cause of the disease is a hemizygous, heterozygous, or homozygous (rare) gain-of-function (GOF) variant (X-linked inheritance pattern) in the terminal regulatory exon of ALAS2. GOF variants increase ALAS2 activity resulting in pathway upregulation and high levels of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX). Males with hemizygous variants frequently present in early childhood with severe cutaneous photosensitivity and laboratory markers of liver disease. Heterozygous females can present with symptoms ranging from as severe as affected males to asymptomatic due to random X-chromosome inactivation. This disease is clinically indistinguishable from FECH-related erythropoietic protoporphyria.
MONDO:0011068	definition	An inherited susceptibility or predisposition to developing type 1 diabetes mellitus in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the CTLA4 gene.	
MONDO:0011841	definition		Any thiamine-responsive dysfunction syndrome in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the SLC19A3 gene, characterized by subacute encephalopathy with confusion, seizures, and movement disorder, often following a history of febrile illness.
MONDO:0012341	definition	Any celiac disease in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the CTLA4 gene.	
MONDO:0012969	definition	Any microvascular complications of diabetes, susceptibility in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the PON1 gene.	
MONDO:0013000	definition	An extremely rare form of acute hepatic porphyria characterized by neuro-visceral attacks without cutaneous manifestations.	A hepatic porphyria caused by biallelic variants in ALAD (in an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern). This is an extremely rare form of hepatic porphyria characterized by neuro-visceral attacks, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, neuropathy, and abdominal pain without cutaneous manifestations. Because the disease is so rare, inducible triggers are not well-documented.
MONDO:0013731	definition		A congenital myopathy caused by mutations in the multiple epidermal growth factor-like domains 10 (MEGF10) gene, which causes early-onset myopathy characterized by severe weakness, scoliosis, joint contractures, areflexia, respiratory distress, and dysphagia, and a milder phenotype of minicore myopathy.
MONDO:0014213	definition		A rare, genetic, neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by global developmental delay, borderline to severe intellectual disability, feeding difficulties, behavioral anomalies, vision anomalies and mild facial dysmorphism. Other associated features may include microcephaly, short stature, urogenital or palatal anomalies (e.g. cleft palate), minor cardiac defects, recurrent infections or hearing loss.
MONDO:0014482	definition	Any intellectual disability-expressive aphasia-facial dysmorphism syndrome in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the SETBP1 gene.	Any autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder caused by haploinsufficiency and/or loss-of-function variants in the SETBP1 gene and characterized by intellectual disability, autism, speech difficulty, motor and developmental delays, seizures, hypotonia, behavior challenges, and facial dysmorphisms.
MONDO:0018422	definition	Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 70 is a very rare, complex subtype of hereditary spastic paraplegia that presents in infancy with delayed motor development (i.e. crawling, walking) and is characterized by lower limb spasticity, increased deep tendon reflexes, extensor plantar responses, impaired vibratory sensation at ankles, amyotrophy and borderline intellectual disability. Additional signs may include gait disturbances, Achilles tendon contractures, scoliosis and cerebellar abnormalities.	A rare, complex subtype of hereditary spastic paraplegia that presents in infancy with delayed motor development (i.e. crawling, walking) and is characterized by lower limb spasticity, increased deep tendon reflexes, extensor plantar responses, impaired vibratory sensation at ankles, amyotrophy and borderline intellectual disability. Additional signs may include gait disturbances, Achilles tendon contractures, scoliosis and cerebellar abnormalities.
MONDO:0019123	definition	Continuous spikes and waves during sleep (CSWS) is a rare epileptic encephalopathy of childhood characterized by seizures, an electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern of electrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES) and neurocognitive regression in at least 2 domains of development.	
MONDO:0019415	definition	Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAIT) is a blood disorder that affects pregnant women and their babies. NAIT was first reported in the literature in 1953 and is estimated to occur in as many as 1 in 1200 live births. NAIT results in the destruction of platelets in the fetus or infant due to a mismatch between the mother's platelets and those of the baby. Certain molecules (antigens) on the surface of the baby's platelets are recognized as foreign by the mother's immune system. The mother's immune system then creates antibodies that attack and destroy the baby's platelets. Though NAIT can occur whenever the mother's blood mixes with that of the baby, it is usually triggered when the mother is exposed to the baby's blood during delivery. Many cases of NAIT are mild. Signs and symptoms may include a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and signs of bleeding into the skin such as petechiae and purpura. In the most severe cases, NAIT can cause bleeding episodes that may result in death or long-term disability. Bleeding episodes can occur either during pregnancy or after birth. Management of the infant with neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia may include platelet transfusions, ultrasounds, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Treatment for pregnant mothers at risk for NAIT may include IVIG and steroids.	A rare hematological disease characterized by maternal alloimmunisation against fetal platelet antigens that are inherited from the father and different from those present in the mother, and usually presents as a severe isolated thrombocytopenia in otherwise healthy newborns.
