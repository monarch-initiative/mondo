MONDO:0000291	definition	Granulomatous amebic encephalitis is a life-threatening infection of the brain caused by the free-living amoebae Acanthamoeba spp., Balamuthia mandrillaris and Sappinia pedata. Acanthamoeba species, are commonly found in lakes, swimming pools, tap water, and heating and air conditioning units. The disease affects immunocompromised peple and is very serious. Symptoms include mental status changes, loss of coordination, fever, muscular weakness or partial paralysis affecting one side of the body, double vision, sensitivity to light and other neurologic problems. The diagnosis is difficult and is often made at advanced stages. Tests useful in the diagnosis include brain scans, biopsies, or spinal taps and in disseminated disease, biopsy of the involved sites and testing by the laboratory experts. Early diagnosis is important for the prognosis. No single drug is effective; hence multiple antibiotics are needed for successful treatment. A combination of surgical and medical interventions involving multiple specialty experts is required to prevent death and morbidity in survivors.

A dopa-responsive dystonia characterized by marked motor delay, but no intellectual disability, and only minimal, if any, hyperphenylalaninemia.
MONDO:0100160	definition	An acute disease characterized by severe ketoacidosis in the absence of diabetes mellitus and occuring in individuals with a history of prolonged excessive alcohol consumption. Disease manifestations include nausea, intractable vomiting, and abdominal pain. When treated, AKA resolves rapidly and completely with no apparent sequelae.

MONDO:0100187	definition	A constipation disorder caused by use of opiods. OIC may present immediately when a patient takes the opioid, or it may present gradually during opioid therapy.

Osteoporosis occurring in premenopausal women with existing fragility fractures, diseases or treatments known to cause bone loss or fractures.
MONDO:0700093	definition	Robertsonian translocation Down syndrome in which translocation displacement of the end regions of chromosomes occured without loss of chromosomal material between the two nonhomologous chromosomes.	Robertsonian translocation Down syndrome in which translocation displacement of the end regions of chromosomes occurred without loss of chromosomal material between the two nonhomologous chromosomes.
MONDO:0700094	definition	Robertsonian translocation Down syndrome in which translocation displacement of the end regions of chromosomes occured with loss of chromosomal material between the two nonhomologous chromosomes.	Robertsonian translocation Down syndrome in which translocation displacement of the end regions of chromosomes occurred with loss of chromosomal material between the two nonhomologous chromosomes.
MONDO:0800120	definition	A rare lung condidtion characterized by often predominantly unilateral lung hyperlucency and air trapping. The condition is a post-infectious form of bronchiolitis obliterans and typically follows a viral respiratory infection in infancy and childhood. Adenovirus infection is considered the most usual epidemiology. In SJS, the involved lung or portion of the lung does not grow normally and is slightly smaller than the opposite lung: in particular, peripheral branches of the pulmonary vessels do not develop, and vasculature is arreseted at the stage at which the infection occurred. Patients respond well to management with bronchodilators, even though this is not primarily a bronchial abnormality.

MONDO:0800306	definition		Any Lafora disease in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the NHLRC1 gene.
MONDO:0800384	definition	A heavy metal poisoning that is caused by exposure to cessium.	A heavy metal poisoning that is caused by exposure to cesium.
MONDO:0958199	definition		Any Lafora disease in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the EPM2A gene.
MONDO:0958348	definition	A rare closed dysraphism with terminal stalk characterized by persistant rudimentary spinal cord below conus. It contains non-functional neural tissue and is typically isolated. The diagnostic is suggested by attenuated conus without fat, further confirmed by pathological analysis (glioneuronal core with ependyma-lined lumen, nerve roots, and dorsal root ganglia). Differential diagnostic with intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring is mandatory as neuroimaging fails to distinguish it from functional conus.
