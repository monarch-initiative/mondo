MONDO:0005775	definition	An X-linked genetic condition caused by alterations in the gene G6PD that result in moderately to severely decreased activity levels of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Most individuals with G6PD deficiency are asymptomatic. Individuals with G6PD variants that cause G6PD deficiency are at risk for acute hemolytic anemia in response to certain medication exposures, chemical exposures, infections, or consumption of fava beans.	An X-linked genetic condition caused by alterations in the gene G6PD that result in moderately to severely decreased activity levels of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Most individuals with G6PD deficiency are asymptomatic. Individuals with G6PD variants that cause G6PD deficiency are at risk for neonatal jaundice. These individuals are also at risk for acute hemolytic anemia in response to certain medication exposures, chemical exposures, infections, or consumption of fava beans.
MONDO:0005594	definition	A permanent mark left on the skin in the process of wound healing.	A group of skin disorders including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and generalized bullous fixed drug eruptions (GBFDE).
MONDO:0006553	definition	Fox-Fordyce disease isa chronic skin diseasemost common in women aged 13-35 years.It is characterized by the development of intense itching in the underarm area, the pubic area, and around the nipple of the breast as a result of perspiration which becomes trapped in the sweat gland and surrounding areas. The cause is unknown,but heat, humidity, and stress may play a role. Treatment may include the use of retinoids, antibiotics, and immunosuppressants.

MONDO:0009868	definition	Glycogen storage disease (GSD) due to liver and muscle phosphorylase kinase (PhK) deficiency is a benign inborn error of glycogen metabolism. It is the mildest form of GSD due to PhK deficiency.	A disorder of glycogen metabolism caused by a deficiency in liver and muscle phosphorylase kinase subunit b, is autosomal recessive and can lead to hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia after prolonged fasting, and growth retardation.
MONDO:0017771	definition	Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome describes a spectrum of Mullerian duct anomalies characterized by congenital aplasia of the uterus and upper 2/3 of the vagina in otherwise phenotypically normal females. It can be classified as either MRKH syndrome type 1 (corresponding to isolated utero-vaginal aplasia) or MRKH syndrome type 2 (utero-vaginal aplasia associated with other malformations).	Spectrum of Mullerian duct anomalies characterized by congenital aplasia of the uterus and upper 2/3 of the vagina in otherwise phenotypically normal females. It can be classified as either MRKH syndrome type 1 (corresponding to isolated utero-vaginal aplasia) or MRKH syndrome type 2 (utero-vaginal aplasia associated with other malformations).
MONDO:0010802	definition	Pancreatic hypoplasia-diabetes-congenital heart disease syndrome is characterized by partial pancreatic agenesis, diabetes mellitus, and heart anomalies (including transposition of the great vessels, ventricular or atrial septal defects, pulmonary stenosis, or patent ductus arteriosis).	A rare, syndromic diabetes mellitus characterized by partial pancreatic agenesis, diabetes mellitus, and heart anomalies (including transposition of the great vessels, ventricular or atrial septal defects, pulmonary stenosis, or patent ductus arteriosis).
MONDO:0011876	definition	Juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE) is a genetic epilepsy with onset occurring around puberty. JAE is characterized by sporadic occurrence of absence seizures, frequently associated with a long-life prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and sporadic myoclonic jerks.	
MONDO:0012280	definition	Goldberg-Shprintzen megacolon syndrome is a multiple malformation syndrome characterized by Hirschprung megacolon with microcephaly, hypertelorism, submucous cleft palate, short stature and learning disability.	A multiple malformation syndrome characterized by Hirschprung megacolon with microcephaly, hypertelorism, submucous cleft palate, short stature and learning disability.
MONDO:0014855	definition	Any autosomal dominant non-syndromic intellectual disability in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the GNB1 gene.	Any autosomal dominant non-syndromic intellectual disability in which the cause of the disease is a heterozygous mutation in the GNB1 gene. It is characterized by global developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, structural brain abnormalities, and seizures. Other less common findings include dystonia, visual impairment, behavior problems, growth delay, craniofacial defects, and genitourinary abnormalities in males.
MONDO:0016499	definition	Acute pandysautonomia is a rare variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome characterized by acute post-ganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic failure presenting several weeks after acute infection with gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, gastroparesis, ileus), orthostatic hypotension, erectile dysfunction, urinary frequency, urgency or retention, vasomotor instability with acrocyanosis and reduced salivation, lacrimation and sweating.	A rare variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome characterized by acute post-ganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic failure presenting several weeks after acute infection with gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, gastroparesis, ileus), orthostatic hypotension, erectile dysfunction, urinary frequency, urgency or retention, vasomotor instability with acrocyanosis and reduced salivation, lacrimation and sweating.
MONDO:0017681	definition	A type of erythrokeratoderma characterized by the association of hyperkeratosis and erythema in persistent, although sometimes variable, circumscribed lesions. Progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma (PSEK) and erythrokeratoderma variabilis (EKV) are probably no longer two distinctive diseases but rather the two clinical manifestations of a same disease, now known as EKVP.	
MONDO:0024349	definition		"A prevalent and benign dermatological condition that predominantly affects children and adolescents. The name \pityriasis alba\"" derives from its appearance, where \""pityriasis\"" denotes the fine scales and \""alba\"" signifies the pale color (hypopigmentation)."""
