MONDO:0005272	definition	A myelodysplastic syndrome characterized mainly by dysplasia of the erythroid series. Refractory anemia is uncommon. It is primarily a disease of older adults. The median survival exceeds 5 years. (WHO, 2001)	A myelodysplastic syndrome characterized by dysplasia seen in at least 10% of the early cells of 1 cell type (either red blood cells, white blood cells, or megakaryocytes) in the bone marrow.
MONDO:0006763	definition	Inflammation or irritation of a bursa, the fibrous sac that acts as a cushion between moving structures of bones, muscles, tendons or skin.	A painful inflammatory process leads to a mechanical block in active and passive range of motion (ROM) of the shoulder. Adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder is characterized by functional loss of passive and active shoulder motion. This inflammatory process results in fibroblastic proliferation and extensive scar tissue formation. Fibroblastic proliferation, a late phase of the inflammatory process involved in tissue repair, leads to thickening, fibrosis, and adhesion of the capsule to itself and the humerus.
MONDO:0008357	definition	Radial hypoplasia-triphalangeal thumbs-hypospadias-maxillary diastema syndrome is characterised by symmetric, nonopposable triphalangeal thumbs and radial hypoplasia. It has been described in eight patients (five females and three males) spanning generations of a family. The affected males also presented with hypospadias. The syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.	A syndrome is characterised by symmetric, nonopposable triphalangeal thumbs and radial hypoplasia. It has been described in eight patients (five females and three males) spanning generations of a family. The affected males also presented with hypospadias. The syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.
MONDO:0800153	definition	A disorder of amino acid metabolism that has its basis in the disruption of the urea cycle and/or there is an inherited increased concentration of ammonia in the blood.	A disorder of amino acid metabolism that has its basis in the disruption of the urea cycle or an inherited hyperammonemia (any specific disease which causes an inherited increased concentration of ammonia in the blood).
MONDO:0008996	definition	A very rare subtype of Joubert syndrome and related disorders (JSRD) characterized by the neurological features of JS associated with congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF).	OBSOLETE. A very rare subtype of Joubert syndrome and related disorders (JSRD) characterized by the neurological features of JS associated with congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF).
MONDO:0009842	definition		An autoinflammatory disease with defective neutrophil function caused by a homozygous Arg219His mutation in the transcription factor C/EBPÎµ.
MONDO:0010613	definition	An inherited metabolic disease that is has its basis in the disruption of glycerol kinase activity.	An acquired metabolic disease that has its basis in the disruption of glycerol kinase activity.
MONDO:0019775	definition	Chudley-Lowry syndrome is an X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) syndrome belonging to the group of conditions characterised by the association of intellectual deficit with hypotonic facies (Mental retardation-hypotonic facies).

MONDO:0019779	definition	Renier-Gabreels-Jasper syndrome is an X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) syndrome belonging to the group of conditions characterised by the association of intellectual deficit with hypotonic facies (Mental retardation, X-linked-hypotonic facies).	OBSOLETE. Renier-Gabreels-Jasper syndrome is an X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) syndrome belonging to the group of conditions characterised by the association of intellectual deficit with hypotonic facies (Mental retardation, X-linked-hypotonic facies).
MONDO:0030491	definition		An autosomal recessive immunodeficiency caused by a variation in the ZNFX1 gene, characterized by severe infections by both RNA and DNA viruses and virally triggered inflammatory episodes with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like disease, early-onset seizures, and renal and lung disease.
