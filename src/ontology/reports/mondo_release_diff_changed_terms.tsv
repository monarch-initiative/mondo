MONDO:0010123	definition	An exceedingly rare, autosomal recessive immune disease characterized by thumb aplasia, short stature with skeletal abnormalities, and combined immunodeficiency described in three sibships from two possibly related families. The skeletal abnormalities included unfused olecranon and the immunodeficiency manifested with severe chickenpox and chronic candidiasis. No new cases have been reported since 1978.	OBSOLETE.

MONDO:0044300	definition	Familial adenomatous polyposis-4 is an autosomal recessive tumor predisposition syndrome characterized by the development of multiple colonic adenomas in adulthood, often with progression to colorectal cancer. Proliferative lesions in other tissues may also occur (summary by {1:Adam et al., 2016}).nnFor a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of familial adenomatous polyposis, see FAP1 (OMIM:175100).

Proliferative lesions in other tissues may also occur.
