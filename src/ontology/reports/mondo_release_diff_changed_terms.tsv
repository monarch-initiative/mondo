MONDO:0044219	definition	The Duffy blood group system, which consists of 4 alleles, 5 phenotypes, and 5 antigens, is important in clinical medicine because of transfusion incompatibilities and hemolytic disease of the newborn. Duffy antigens are located on ACKR1 (OMIM:613665), or DARC, an acidic glycoprotein found on erythrocytes and other cells throughout the body. The 2 principal antigens, Fy(a) and Fy(b), are produced by the FYA and FYB codominant alleles (see {613665.0001}). Four phenotypes are defined by the corresponding antibodies, anti-Fy(a) and anti-Fy(b): Fy(a+b-), Fy(a-b+), Fy(a+b+), and Fy(a-b-). Fy(a-b-), or Duffy null, is the major phenotype in African and American blacks and is characterized by the presence of Fy(b) on nonerythroid cells, but an absence of Fy(b) on erythrocytes. The Fy(a-b-) phenotype is associated with complete resistance to infection by the malarial parasite Plasmodium vivax (see OMIM:611162). Individuals with the Fy(a-b-) phenotype have the FYB-erythroid silent (FYB-ES) allele with a mutation in the DARC promoter ({613665.0002}). A fifth phenotype, Fy(bwk), or Fy(x), is characterized by weak Fy(b) expression on erythrocytes due to a reduced amount of protein. Individuals with the Fy(bwk) phenotype have the FYB-weak (FYB-WK) allele, also called the FYX allele, with a missense mutation in DARC ({613665.0003}). Other Duffy antigens include Fy3, Fy4, Fy5, and Fy6 (reviews by {21:Pogo and Chaudhuri (2000)}, {10:Langhi and Bordin (2006)}, and {14:Meny (2010)}).	OBSOLETE.

MONDO:0044228	definition	Since the initial discovery of the human electroencephalogram (EEG) by {1:Berger (1929)}, it has been speculated that neural oscillations play a broad role in nervous systems and form the basis for higher cognitive functions and consciousness. The presence of a beta/gamma oscillation (18 to 50 Hz) is thought to represent an activated state of the underlying neuronal network. These beta (12-29 Hz) and gamma (30-50 Hz) brain rhythms involve gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptor action ({2:Haenschel et al., 2000}; summary by {3:Porjesz et al., 2002}).	OBSOLETE.

MONDO:0044236	definition	More than 2 billion people have been infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV; see OMIM:610424), and more than 350 million of these people are chronic carriers. Each year more than half a million die as a result of acute or chronic HBV infection. Vaccination has been highly successful at preventing new HBV infections and has been implemented into the national immunization programs of more than 150 countries. However, the immune response to HBV vaccination varies greatly among individuals, with 5 to 10% of healthy adults failing to produce protective levels of antibodies. Several factors have been implicated in determining the response to HBV vaccination, including physical factors, such as age, gender, obesity, immunosuppression, and smoking, as well as variation in genes of the immune system (summary by {2:Davila et al., 2010}).

MONDO:0044240	definition	Perfect pitch, or absolute pitch (AP), is defined as the ability immediately and effortlessly to name a note or collection of notes when they are sounded. Often, persons with perfect pitch possess a memory capacity whereby they can remember the pitch of a note and the configuration of a group or series of notes after a significant interval of time has elapsed. These recognitive and memory talents involve a potential capacity for performing these functions together with a practice factor which is necessary for the maintenance of the skills at the highest level (summary by {12:Profita and Bidder, 1988}).

MONDO:0044257	definition	Autosomal recessive inheritance of the Lutheran null blood group phenotype is extremely rare, and has been reported in only 5 individuals.

Since it is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, it was initially postulated to result from an inhibitor of the Lu antigen. However, {7:Singleton et al.

MONDO:0044259	definition	Two types of melanin, the red pheomelanin and the black eumelanin, are present in human skin. {22:Valverde et al. (1995)} noted that eumelanin is photoprotective, whereas pheomelanin may contribute to UV-induced skin damage because of its potential to generate free radicals in response to ultraviolet radiation. Individuals with red hair have a predominance of pheomelanin in hair and skin and/or a reduced ability to produce eumelanin, which may explain why they fail to tan and are at risk from ultraviolet radiation. In mammals, the relative proportions of pheomelanin and eumelanin are regulated by melanocyte-stimulating hormone (see OMIM:176830), which acts via its receptor (MC1R) on melanocytes to increase the synthesis of eumelanin, and also via the product of the agouti locus (AGTI; OMIM:600201), which antagonizes this action.
