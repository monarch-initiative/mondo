MONDO:0020048	definition	Internal carotid artery (ICA) agenesis (uni or bilateral) is a developmental defect that may be asymptomatic or lead to cerebrovascular lesions. It is a rare malformation, with only around hundred cases reported in the literature. When symptoms are present, they are caused by cerebrovascular insufficiency, compression of the brain by vessels that dilate to compensate for the absence of the ICA, or the presence of an aneurysm. Associated intracranial aneurysms occur in 25 to 35% of patients and are often responsible for intracranial hemorrhage, which may present as the initial symptom. The absence of the ICA is the result of either agenesis or aplasia. The term agenesis is used when both the ICA and its bony canal are absent, whereas there is some evidence of carotid canals in cases of aplasia. The absence of the ICA can be detected by angiography or by computerised tomography.

MONDO:0020398	definition	Congenital mitral stenosis is a congenital heart malformation comprising a spectrum of morphologically heterogeneous developmental anomalies that result in functional and anatomic obstruction of inflow into the left ventricle. The structure of the mitral valve is affected at the level of the supravalvular ring, annulus, leaflets or subvalvar copmponents and include supra-valvular ring, leaflet fusion (intra-leaflet ring), mitral parachute deformity and papillary muscle abnormalities. It may be isolated or associated with other heart malformations. The clinical presentation depends on the degree of obstruction, the presence of regurgitation, the presence and severity of associated pulmonary hypertension, and the presence of associated heart malformations. It may present with symptoms and signs of low cardiac output and right ventricular failure such as pulmonary infections, failure to thrive, exertional dyspnoea, cough, cyanosis and congestive heart failure.

MONDO:0023152	definition	Fibrocartilaginous embolism (FCE) is a rare type of embolism (sudden blocking of an artery) that occurs in the spinal cord. FCE occurs when materials that are usually found within the vertebral disc of the spine enter into the nearby vascular system (veins and arteries) and block one of the spinal cord vessels. The signs and symptoms of FCE often develop after a minor or even unnoticed btriggering eventb such as lifting, straining, or falling. Symptoms of FCE may include neck and/or back pain, progressive muscle weakness, and paralysis.The exact underlying cause of FCE is poorly understood. Most cases occur sporadically in people with no family history of the disease. Diagnosis is based on imaging of the spinal cord and ruling out other causes of a blockage of the vascular system within the spinal cord. Treatment is generally focused on preventing possible complications and improving quality of life with medications and physical therapy.
