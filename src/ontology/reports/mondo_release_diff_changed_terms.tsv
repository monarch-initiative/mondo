MONDO:0009068	definition	A very rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by deficiency of the enzyme cytochrome-C oxidase. It may be manifested as an isolated myopathy or a systemic disorder. Signs and symptoms include myotonia, dysfunction of the heart, kidney, and brain, and lactic acidosis.	
MONDO:0009696	definition	Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is the most common hereditary idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndrome and is characterized by myoclonic jerks of the upper limbs on awakening, generalized tonic-clonic seizures manifesting during adolescence and triggered by sleep deprivation, alcohol intake, and cognitive activities, and typical absence seizures (30% of cases).	The most common hereditary idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndrome and is characterized by myoclonic jerks of the upper limbs on awakening, generalized tonic-clonic seizures manifesting during adolescence and triggered by sleep deprivation, alcohol intake, and cognitive activities, and typical absence seizures (30% of cases).
MONDO:0018097	definition	West syndrome (or infantile spasms) is characterized by the association of clusters of axial spasms, psychomotor retardation and an hypsarrhythmic interictal EEG pattern. It is the most frequent type of epileptic encephalopathy. It may occur in otherwise healthy infants and in those with abnormal cognitive development.	A rare epilepsy syndrome characterized by onset of epileptic spasms in infants between 2 and 12 months of age, and rarely up to 24 months. Infants may have no antecedent history, or a history reflecting the underlying cause. The classical triad of epileptic spasms, hypsarrhythmia and developmental stagnation or regression is historically referred to as West syndrome.
MONDO:0012466	definition	Any young-onset Parkinson disease in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the HTRA2 gene.	An inherited susceptibility or predisposition to developing young-onset Parkinson disease, in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the HTRA2 gene.

MONDO:0033885	definition		A very rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by deficiency of the enzyme cytochrome-C oxidase. It may be manifested as an isolated myopathy or a systemic disorder. Signs and symptoms include myotonia, dysfunction of the heart, kidney, and brain, and lactic acidosis.
MONDO:0013784	definition	A rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by neonatal onset of rigidity and intractable seizures, with episodic jerking already beginning in utero. Affected infants have small heads, remain visually inattentive, do not feed independently, and make no developmental progress. Frequent spontaneous apnea and bradycardia usually culminate in cardiopulmonary arrest and death in infancy, although some cases were described with a milder clinical course and survival into childhood.	A rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by neonatal onset of rigidity and intractable seizures, with episodic jerking already beginning in utero. Affected infants have small heads, remain visually inattentive, do not feed independently, and make no developmental progress. Frequent spontaneous apnea and bradycardia usually culminate in cardiopulmonary arrest and death in infancy, although some cases were described with a milder clinical course and survival into childhood. The cause of the disease is a variation in the BRAT1 gene.
MONDO:0015422	definition	Orofaciodigital syndrome type 13 is a rare subtype of orofaciodigital syndrome, with sporadic occurrence, characterized by cardiac (mitral and tricuspid valve dysplasia) and neuropsychiatric manifestations (epilepsy, depression), in addition to oral, facial and digital malformations (lingual hamartomas, cleft lip, and brachydactyly, clinodactyly, syndactyly of hands and feet). Leukoaraiosis, on brain MRI examination, is also associated.	OBSOLETE. Orofaciodigital syndrome type 13 is a rare subtype of orofaciodigital syndrome, with sporadic occurrence, characterized by cardiac (mitral and tricuspid valve dysplasia) and neuropsychiatric manifestations (epilepsy, depression), in addition to oral, facial and digital malformations (lingual hamartomas, cleft lip, and brachydactyly, clinodactyly, syndactyly of hands and feet). Leukoaraiosis, on brain MRI examination, is also associated.
MONDO:0016676	definition	Hyperzincemia and hypercalprotectinemia is a rare inborn error of zinc metabolism characterized by recurrent infections, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia (unresponsive to iron supplementation) and chronic systemic inflammation in the presence of high plasma concentrations of zinc and calprotectin. Patients typically present dermal ulcers or other cutaneous manifestations (e.g. inflammation) and arthralgia. Severe epistaxis and spontaneous hematomas have also been reported.	
MONDO:0020841	definition		An an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by intellectual disability associated with ataxia, in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the BRAT1 gene.
MONDO:0022577	definition	A congenital malformation syndrome characterized by partial duplication of the left lower limb and aplasia of the ipsilateral kidney, plus other congenital malformations.	OBSOLETE. A congenital malformation syndrome characterized by partial duplication of the left lower limb and aplasia of the ipsilateral kidney, plus other congenital malformations.
MONDO:0025419	definition	A persistent skin infection marked by the presence of furuncles, often chronic and recurrent. In humans, the causative agent is various species of staphylococcus. In salmonid fish (salmonids), the pathogen is aeromonas salmonicida.	A persistent skin infection marked by the presence of furuncles, often chronic and recurrent. In salmonid fish (salmonids), the pathogen is Aeromonas salmonicida.
MONDO:0100095	definition	Autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder with onset in the first years of life following normal early development, with cyclic episodic deterioration in response to stress, such as infection or febrile illness. The severity is highly variable. The cause is mutations in the ADPRHL2 gene.
