MONDO:0016036	definition	Ledderhose disease is a type of plantar fibromatosis characterized by the growth of hard and round or flattened nodules (lumps) on the soles of the feet.

Patients present with sudden unexplained foot pain, inability to bear weight, and limping. Radiographic features include flattening, fragmentation, and patchy sclerosis of the navicular bone. Soft tissue swelling may be associated. The condition is most commonly unilateral and self-limiting. Boys are more often affected than girls.
MONDO:0018919	definition	McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) is classically defined by the clinical triad of fibrous dysplasia of bone (FD), cafC)-au-lait skin spots, and precocious puberty (PP).	McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) is classically defined by the clinical triad of fibrous dysplasia of bone (FD), cafe-au-lait skin spots, and precocious puberty (PP).
MONDO:0019511	definition	An inherited disorder that causes a gradual loss of kidney function that eventually leads to the need for kidney transplantation or dialysis between the ages of 30 and 70, which is caused by a mutation in the UMOD gene, which leads to the build-up of the altered uromodulin protein in the tubules of the kidney, leading to slow loss of kidney function. Patients with ADTKD-UMOD have high blood levels of uric acid before kidney failure develops, and some affected individuals may develop gout.	
MONDO:0019774	definition	Holmes-Gang syndrome is an X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) syndrome belonging to the group of conditions characterised by the association of intellectual deficit with hypotonic facies (Mental retardation, X-linked-hypotonic facies).	OBSOLETE. Holmes-Gang syndrome is an X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) syndrome belonging to the group of conditions characterised by the association of intellectual deficit with hypotonic facies (Mental retardation, X-linked-hypotonic facies).
MONDO:0020358	definition	Coloboma of optic disc is a rare, genetic, developmental defect of the eye characterized by a unilateral or bilateral, sharply demarcated, bowl-shaped, glistening white excavation on the optic disc (typically decentered inferiorly) which usually manifests with varying degrees of reduced visual acuity. It can occur isolated or may associate other ocular (e.g. retinal detachment, retinoschisis-like separation) or systemic anomalies (e.g. renal).	
MONDO:0020368	definition	Axenfeld's anomaly is a rare congenital ocular defect caused by anterior segment dysgenesis and is characterized by anteriorly displaced SchwalbeBs line and iris bands extending into the cornea. In contrast, RiegerBs anomaly includes characteristic iris and pupil anomalies.	Axenfeld's anomaly is a rare congenital ocular defect caused by anterior segment dysgenesis and is characterized by anteriorly displaced Schwalbe's line and iris bands extending into the cornea. In contrast, Rieger's anomaly includes characteristic iris and pupil anomalies.
MONDO:0021191	definition	A malignant form of ependymoma.	
MONDO:0044354	definition	Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rare benign non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis characterized by the development of large painless histiocytic masses in the lymph nodes, predominantly of the cervical region. Extranodal involvement can also be observed, such as in the skin, respiratory tract, bones, genitourinary system, soft tissues, oral cavity, and central nervous system. Additional findings may include fever, malaise, epistaxis, night sweats, weight loss, leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and hypergammaglobulinemia.	
MONDO:0056821	definition	Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is a lung disease that causes inflammation in the small air tubes (bronchioles) and air sacs (alveoli). BOOP typically develops in individuals between 40-60 years old; however the disorder may affect individuals of any age. The signs and symptoms of BOOP vary but often include shortness of breath, a dry cough, and fever. BOOP can be caused by viral infections, various drugs, and other medical conditions. If the cause is known, the condition is called secondary BOOP. In many cases, the underlying cause of BOOP is unknown. These cases are called idiopathic BOOP or cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Treatment often includes corticosteroid medications.	
MONDO:0060490	definition		A rare genetic syndromic intellectual disability characterized by infantile onset of global developmental delay and profound intellectual disability in association with a heterogeneous spectrum of manifestations, such as features of lower motor neuron disease, hypotonia, spasticity, contractures, seizures, respiratory insufficiency, and optic atrophy, among others. Dysmorphic craniofacial features include microcephaly, tall forehead, bitemporal narrowing, flat nasal bridge, low-set ears, and high-arched palate. Brain imaging may show cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, delayed myelination, and thin corpus callosum.
MONDO:0100243	definition	An instance of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria that is inherited.	
MONDO:0100245	definition	Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by corpuscular hemolytic anemia, bone marrow failure and frequent thrombotic events.	
MONDO:0100461	definition	A rare genetic disease characterized by multiple intestinal atresia in association with combined immunodeficiency and inflammatory bowel disease. Clinical features include widespread atresia extending from the stomach to the rectum, homogenous calcifications in the abdominal cavity, hepatic cholestasis, cirrhosis, and chronic liver failure, hypoplastic thymus, and increased susceptibility to mainly bacteria and viruses. The immunological phenotype consists of profound generalized T-cell lymphopenia and milder natural killer cell and B-cell lymphopenia, as well as low serum levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM, with elevated serum IgE. The disease is mostly fatal in infancy or childhood.
