MONDO:0016003	definition	Human ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis describe a group of acute febrile tick-borne diseases characterized by an overlapping clinical picture that includes fever, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, skin eruptions, gastrointestinal symptoms and neurological manifestations. Diseases in this group include human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (HME), human granulocytotropic anaplasmosis (HGA), and human ehrlichiosis ewingii (HEE).	An disease or disorder caused by infection with Ehrlichia.
MONDO:0000332	definition	An ehlrichiosis caused by Neorickettsia sennetsu.	A disease caused by infection with Neorickettsia sennetsu.
MONDO:0005775	definition	An X-linked recessive inherited disorder caused by mutations in the G6PD gene. It is characterized by the absence or presence of very low levels of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Patients develop hemolytic anemia usually in response to infection or exposure to drugs.	An X-linked genetic condition caused by alterations in the gene G6PD that result in moderately to severely decreased activity levels of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Most individuals with G6PD deficiency are asymptomatic. Individuals with G6PD variants that cause G6PD deficiency are at risk for acute hemolytic anemia in response to certain medication exposures, chemical exposures, infections, or consumption of fava beans.
MONDO:0025303	definition	An disease or disorder caused by infection with Anaplasma.	A disease or disorder caused by infection with Anaplasma.
MONDO:0100150	definition		A disorder of the musculoskeletal system caused by pathogenic variants in the RYR1 gene, which encodes the ryanodine receptor type 1 protein. These variants are associated with a variety of overlapping features characterized by symmetric proximal muscle weakness, often with pronounced facial weakness with or without dysmorphism and ophthalmoparesis/ophthalmoplegia with ptosis, bulbar weakness, significant respiratory involvement, severe neonatal hypotonia, scoliosis, orthopedic deformities including arthrogryposis, hip dislocation, club feet, and King Denborough syndrome (pectus carinatum or excavatum, short stature, joint contractures, facial and skeletal deformities), malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, anesthesia-induced rhabdomyolysis, fatigue, exercise-induced hyperthermia/exertional heat stroke, and exertional myalgia. Histologic findings on skeletal muscle biopsy reveal a wide range of structural abnormalities and can include central core disease, multiminicore disease, cone-rod myopathy, centronuclear myopathy, and congenital fiber-type disproportion.
MONDO:0010480	definition		An X-linked genetic condition caused by alterations in the gene G6PD that result in severely decreased activity levels of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Individuals with hemizygous G6PD variants associated with CNSHA have CNSHA. Individuals with G6PD variants that cause CNSHA are at risk for acute hemolytic anemia in response to certain medication exposures, chemical exposures, infections, or consumption of fava beans.
MONDO:0100318	definition	A viral disease or post-viral disorder caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or the associated aftereffects of the disease.	OBSOLETE. A viral disease or post-viral disorder caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or the associated aftereffects of the disease.
MONDO:0100321	definition	A viral infectious disease that result from the presence and activity of a viral agent, or a disorder that follows infection with an viral agent but is distinct from the usual manifestations of the infection itself.	OBSOLETE. A viral infectious disease that result from the presence and activity of a viral agent, or a disorder that follows infection with an viral agent but is distinct from the usual manifestations of the infection itself.
MONDO:0100336	definition	A disease or disorder that result from the presence and activity of a microbial, viral, fungal or parasitic agent, or a disorder that follows infection with an infectious agent but is distinct from the usual manifestations of the infection itself.	OBSOLETE. A disease or disorder that result from the presence and activity of a microbial, viral, fungal or parasitic agent, or a disorder that follows infection with an infectious agent but is distinct from the usual manifestations of the infection itself.
