MONDO:0000152	definition		A disorder of thiamine metabolism and transport results from deficiency of thiamine metabolism, comprises a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous encephalopathies with autosomal recessive inheritance.
MONDO:0015597	definition		A rare skin disease characterized by chronic eruption of sterile pustules on an erythematous and desquamative background, affecting the palms and soles, sometimes also the lateral aspects of hands and feet. The lesions are usually painful. Nail lesions (such as nail pitting, onycholysis, subungual pustules, and nail dystrophy) are also observed. The condition takes a chronic and relapsing course. Typical associations are psoriatic arthritis, thyroid gland dysfunction, and smoking.
MONDO:0004762	definition		A uterine disorder characterised by chronic pelvic pain caused by reflux or obstruction of the ovarian or pelvic veins, often associated with pelvic or vulvar varicosities.
MONDO:0006592	definition	Parapsoriasis describes a group ofskin diseases that can be characterized by scaly patches or slightly elevated papules and/or plaques (red, scaly patches) that have a resemblance to psoriasis. However, this description includes several inflammatory cutaneous diseases that are unrelated with respect to pathogenesis, histopathology, and response to treatment. Because of the variation in clinical presentation and a lack of a specific diagnostic finding on histopathology, a uniformly accepted definition of parapsoriasis remains lacking. There are 2 general forms: a small plaque type, which is usually benign, and a large plaque type, which is a precursor of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).Treatment of small plaque parapsoriasis is unnecessary but can include emollients, topical tar preparations or corticosteroids, and/or phototherapy. Treatment of large plaque parapsoriasis is phototherapy or topical corticosteroids.	An inflammatory skin disorder of unknown etiology characterized by papules and plaques or scaly patches resembling psoriasis.
MONDO:0008025	definition	Any neuronopathy, distal hereditary motor in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the HSPB8 gene.	Any neuronopathy, distal hereditary motor in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the HSPB8 gene. The presenting symptoms are paresis of the extensor muscles of the big toe and later of the extensor muscles of the feet and chronic neurogenic alterations in electromyography.
MONDO:0011841	definition		Any thiamine-responsive dysfunction syndrome in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the SLC19A3 gene, characterized by subacute encephalopathy with confusion, seizures, and movement disorder, often following a history of febrile illness.
MONDO:0014213	definition		A rare, genetic, neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by global developmental delay, borderline to severe intellectual disability, feeding difficulties, behavioral anomalies, vision anomalies and mild facial dysmorphism. Other associated features may include microcephaly, short stature, urogenital or palatal anomalies (e.g. cleft palate), minor cardiac defects, recurrent infections or hearing loss.
MONDO:0016606	definition	OBSOLETE. Prenatal benign hypophosphatasia (PB-HPP) is a very rare form of hypophosphatasia characterized by prenatal skeletal manifestations (limb shortening and bowing) that slowly resolve spontaneously and later develop into the milder infantile, childhood or adult forms of the disease.	
MONDO:0017049	definition	OBSOLETE. Hypomyelination neuropathy-arthrogryposis syndrome is a rare, genetic, limb malformation syndrome characterized by multiple congenital distal joint contractures (incl. talipes equinovarus and both proximal and distal interphalangeal joint contractures of the hands) and very severe motor paralysis at birth (i.e. lack of swallowing, autonomous respiratory function and deep tendon reflexes), leading to death within first 3 months of life. Fetal hypo- or akinesia, late-onset polyhydramnios and dramatically reduced, or absent, motor nerve conduction velocities (<10 m/s) are frequently associated. Nerve ultrastructural morphology shows severe abnormalities of the nodes of Ranvier and myelinated axons.	
MONDO:0017629	definition		OBSOLETE. A rare, genetic, peripheral neuropathy disorder due to gain-of-function mutations in voltage-gated sodium channels present in the small peripheral nerve fibers characterized by neuropathic pain of varying intensity (often beginning in the distal extermities and with a burning quality) associated with autonomic dysfunction (e.g. orthostatic dizziness, palpitations, dry eyes and mouth), abnormal quantitative sensory testing, and reduction in intraepidermal nerve ﬁber density. Large fiber functions (i.e. normal strength, tendon reflexes, and vibration sense) and nerve conduction studies are typically normal.
MONDO:0018422	definition	Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 70 is a very rare, complex subtype of hereditary spastic paraplegia that presents in infancy with delayed motor development (i.e. crawling, walking) and is characterized by lower limb spasticity, increased deep tendon reflexes, extensor plantar responses, impaired vibratory sensation at ankles, amyotrophy and borderline intellectual disability. Additional signs may include gait disturbances, Achilles tendon contractures, scoliosis and cerebellar abnormalities.	A rare, complex subtype of hereditary spastic paraplegia that presents in infancy with delayed motor development (i.e. crawling, walking) and is characterized by lower limb spasticity, increased deep tendon reflexes, extensor plantar responses, impaired vibratory sensation at ankles, amyotrophy and borderline intellectual disability. Additional signs may include gait disturbances, Achilles tendon contractures, scoliosis and cerebellar abnormalities.
MONDO:0018758	definition	OBSOLETE. Familial patent arterial duct is a rare, genetic, non-syndromic, congenital anomaly of the great arteries characterized by the presence of an isolated patent arterial duct (PDA) (i.e. failure of closure of ductus arteriosis after birth) in several members of the same family. Clinical presentation is similar to the sporadic form and may range from neonatal-onset tachypnea, diaphoresis and failure to thrive to adult-onset atrial arrhythmia, signs and symptoms of heart failure and cyanosis limited to the lower extremities.	
MONDO:0976133	definition		A rare genetic neuromuscular disease caused by a mutation in HSPB8 gene, characterized by length-dependent axonal motor neuropathy predominantly affecting the lower limbs, in combination with a myopathy with morphological features of myofibrillar myopathy with aggregates and rimmed vacuoles.
MONDO:0019123	definition	Continuous spikes and waves during sleep (CSWS) is a rare epileptic encephalopathy of childhood characterized by seizures, an electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern of electrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES) and neurocognitive regression in at least 2 domains of development.	
MONDO:0019174	definition	OBSOLETE. Infantile Refsum disease (IRD) is the mildest variant of the peroxisome biogenesis disorders, Zellweger syndrome spectrum (PBD- ZSS), characterized by hypotonia, retinitis pigmentosa, developmental delay, sensorineural hearing loss and liver dysfunction. Phenotypic overlap is seen between IRD and neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD).	
MONDO:0023297	definition	Guttate psoriasis is a skin condition in which small, red, and scaly teardrop-shaped spots appear on the arms, legs, and middle of the body.It is a relatively uncommon form of psoriasis. The condition often develops very suddenly, and is usually triggered by an infection (e.g., strep throat, bacteria infection, upper respiratory infections or other viral infections). Other triggers include injury to the skin, including cuts, burns, and insect bites, certain malarial and heart medications, stress, sunburn, and excessive alcohol consumption. Treatment depends on the severity of the symptoms, ranging from at-home over the counter remedies to medicines that suppress the body's immunesystem to sunlight and phototherapy.	A form of psoriasis characterized by a sudden onset of small, red, and scaly teardrop-shaped spots that appear on the arms, legs, and middle of the body, usually triggered by an infection.
MONDO:0034678	definition	OBSOLETE. A rare non-syndromic limb malformation characterized by a hand or foot with more than five digits that has a recognizable anterior/posterior axis of symmetry, either with a hallux- or thumb-like structure or an interdigital space in the middle. The most lateral digits on each side typically resemble fifth fingers or toes. The malformation may be unilateral or bilateral and may occur in isolation or in association with other congenital anomalies. [Orphanet:498494]
