MONDO:0000424	definition	Low serum levels of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) due to poor intestinal absorption, decreased dietary intake, or increased physiologic requirement.	
MONDO:0004980	definition	A chronic inflammatory genetically determined disease of the skin marked by increased ability to form reagin (IgE), with increased susceptibility to allergic rhinitis and asthma, and hereditary disposition to a lowered threshold for pruritus. It is manifested by lichenification, excoriation, and crusting, mainly on the flexural surfaces of the elbow and knee. In infants it is known as infantile eczema.	A common chronic pruritic inflammatory skin disease with a strong genetic component. Onset typically occurs during the first 2 years of life.
MONDO:0001734	definition	Hereditary disease characterized by seizures, mental retardation, developmental delay, and skin and ocular lesions. First signs usually occur during infancy or childhood but in rare cases may not occur until 2nd or 3rd decade.	Hereditary disease characterized by seizures, intellectual disability, developmental delay, and skin and ocular lesions. First signs usually occur during infancy or childhood but in rare cases may not occur until 2nd or 3rd decade.
MONDO:0005775	definition	An X-linked genetic condition caused by alterations in the gene G6PD that result in moderately to severely decreased activity levels of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Most individuals with G6PD deficiency are asymptomatic. Individuals with G6PD variants that cause G6PD deficiency are at risk for neonatal jaundice. These individuals are also at risk for acute hemolytic anemia in response to certain medication exposures, chemical exposures, infections, or consumption of fava beans.	An X-linked genetic condition caused by alterations in the gene G6PD that result in moderately to severely decreased activity levels of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Most individuals with G6PD deficiency are asymptomatic throughout their life. Individuals with G6PD variants that cause G6PD deficiency are at risk for severe neonatal jaundice. These individuals are also at risk for acute hemolytic anemia in response to certain medication exposures, chemical exposures, infections, or consumption of fava beans.
MONDO:0003406	definition	Abnormal sleep-wake schedule or pattern associated with the circadian rhythm which affect the length, timing, and/or rigidity of the sleep-wake cycle relative to the day-night cycle.	Abnormal sleep-wake schedule or pattern associated with the circadian rhythm which affect the length, timing, and/or rigidity of the sleep-wake cycle relative to the day-night cycle. These can include dyssomnias such as circadian rhythm disorders, hypersomnia, and sleep apnea and parasomnias such as bruxism and rapid eye movement sleep disorder.
MONDO:0004587	definition	An instance of night blindness that is caused by an inherited modification of the individual's genome.	
MONDO:0007495	definition	Autosomal dominant dopa-responsive dystonia (DYT5a) is a rare neurometabolic disorder characterized by childhood-onset dystonia that shows a dramatic and sustained response to low doses of levodopa (L-dopa) and that may be associated with parkinsonism at an older age.	An autosomal dominant dopa-responsive dystonia in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the GCH1 gene.
MONDO:0019161	definition	Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) is a primary form of mineralocorticoid resistance presenting in the newborn with renal salt wasting, failure to thrive and dehydration.	A rare, primary form of mineralocorticoid resistance characterized by mild to profound salt wasting either restricted to the kidney (renal pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1), or generalized affecting many organs (generalized pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1). Clinical presentation is in the neonatal period with failure to thrive, vomiting and dehydration with biochemical findings of hyperkalaemia, metabolic acidosis and, elevated plasma aldosterone and renin concentration.
MONDO:0019220	definition		An inherited metabolic disease affecting cobalamin (vitamin B12) intestinal absorption, transport in the blood, uptake by peripheral cells or cellular metabolism.
MONDO:0010480	definition	Any nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the G6PD gene resulting in severely decreased activity levels of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Individuals with hemizygous G6PD variants associated with chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA) have CNSHA. Individuals with G6PD variants that cause CNSHA are at risk for acute hemolytic anemia in response to certain medication exposures, chemical exposures, infections, or consumption of fava beans.	Any nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the G6PD gene resulting in severely decreased activity levels of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Individuals with hemizygous or homozygous G6PD variants associated with chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA) will clinically manifest CNSHA. Individuals with G6PD variants that cause CNSHA are at risk for severe neonatal jaundice and acute exacerbation of their chronic hemolytic anemia in response to certain medication exposures, chemical exposures, infections, or consumption of fava beans.
MONDO:0011089	definition		Patent ductus venosus (PDV) is an extremely rare form of congenital portosystemic shunt that results in the diversion of portal blood into the systemic circulation. Failure of DV closure after birth leads to PDV. PDV results in portal venous blood bypassing the liver and directly entering the systemic circulation, decreasing hepatic blood flow and increasing blood volume and toxic substances in the systemic circulation.
MONDO:0011652	definition	Monosomy 22q13 syndrome (deletion 22q13.3 syndrome or Phelan-McDermid syndrome) is a chromosome microdeletion syndrome characterized by neonatal hypotonia, global developmental delay, normal to accelerated growth, absent to severely delayed speech, and minor dysmorphic features.	A rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by neonatal hypotonia, global developmental delay, normal to accelerated growth, absent to severely delayed speech, and minor dysmorphic features. Phelan-McDermid syndrome can be caused by a deletion at chromosome 22q13 or by mutation in the SHANK3 gene.
MONDO:0018774	definition	A rare, genetic erythrokeratoderma disorder characterized by generalized cutaneous erythema with fine white scales and pruritus refractory to treatment, progressive dilated cardiomyopathy, palmoplantar keratoderma, sparse or absent eyebrows and eyelashes, sparse scalp hair, nail dystrophy, and dental enamel anomalies. Variable features include failure to thrive, developmental delay, and development of corneal opacities. Histology shows psoriasiform acanthosis, hypogranulosis, and compact orthohyperkeratosis.	
MONDO:0022900	definition	Congenital hypothyroidism in which fetal deficiency was severe because of complete absence (athyreosis) of the gland. Physical features may include a larger anterior fontanel, persistence of a posterior fontanel, an umbilical hernia, and a large tongue (macroglossia)	OBSOLETE. Congenital hypothyroidism in which fetal deficiency was severe because of complete absence (athyreosis) of the gland. Physical features may include a larger anterior fontanel, persistence of a posterior fontanel, an umbilical hernia, and a large tongue (macroglossia)
