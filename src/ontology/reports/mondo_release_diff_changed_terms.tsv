MONDO:0010047	definition	Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 5A (SPG5A) is a form of hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by either a pure phenotype of slowly progressive spastic paraplegia of the lower extremities with bladder dysfunction and pes cavus or a complex presentation with additional manifestations including cerebellar signs, nystagmus, distal or generalized muscle atrophy and cognitive impairment. Age of onset is highly variable, ranging from early childhood to adulthood. White matter hyperintensity and cerebellar and spinal cord atrophy may be noted, on brain magnetic resonance imaging, in some patients.

MONDO:0024356	definition		A central sleep apnea syndrome considered to be idiopathic. Central sleep apnea is caused by improper signaling from the brainstem to the respiratory muscles and is triggered by either hypoventilation or hyperventilation. Clinical signs include snoring, insomnia or hypersomnia, difficulty concentrating, and fatigue. Recurrent episodes of hypoxia/hypoxemia have long-term detrimental effects on cardiovascular health.
MONDO:0024357	definition		A central sleep apnea syndrome induced by medication or substance use. Central sleep apnea is caused by improper signaling from the brainstem to the respiratory muscles and is triggered by either hypoventilation or hyperventilation. Clinical signs include snoring, insomnia or hypersomnia, difficulty concentrating, and fatigue. Recurrent episodes of hypoxia/hypoxemia have long-term detrimental effects on cardiovascular health.
MONDO:0024360	definition		A central sleep apnea syndrome induced by sleeping at an altitude higher than 2000 m. Central sleep apnea is caused by improper signaling from the brainstem to the respiratory muscles and is triggered by either hypoventilation or hyperventilation. Clinical signs include snoring, insomnia or hypersomnia, difficulty concentrating, and fatigue. Recurrent episodes of hypoxia/hypoxemia have long-term detrimental effects on cardiovascular health.
