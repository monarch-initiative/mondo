MONDO:0005567	definition	A substance-specific organic brain syndrome that follows the discontinuation of administration or use, or reduction in intake of an addictive substance, e.g. opioids, barbiturates and alcohol; amphetamines or similarly acting sympathomimetics; cocaine; nicotine; sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics. Syndrome manifests with diverse, often painful physical and psychological symptoms, which include but not limited to intense drug craving, anxiety, depression, insomnia, nausea, perspiration, body aches, tremors, hallucinations, and convulsions.	A substance-specific organic brain syndrome that follows the discontinuation of administration or use, or reduction in intake of a substance (including alcohol, prescribed medications and recreational drugs).

MONDO:0005789	definition	Inflammation of the liver in humans caused by hepatitis delta virus, a defective rna virus that can only infect hepatitis B patients. For its viral coating, hepatitis delta virus requires the hepatitis B surface antigens produced by these patients. Hepatitis D can occur either concomitantly with (coinfection) or subsequent to (superinfection) hepatitis B infection. Similar to hepatitis B, it is primarily transmitted by parenteral exposure, such as transfusion of contaminated blood or blood products, but can also be transmitted via sexual or intimate personal contact.

MONDO:0015924	definition	A group of diseases characterized by elevated pulmonary arterial resistance leading to right heart failure. PAH is progressive and potentially fatal. PAH may be idiopathic and/ or familial, or induced by drug or toxin (drug-or toxin-induced PAH) or associated with other diseases like congenital heart disease, connective tissue disease, HIV, schistosomiasis, portal hypertension (PAH associated with other disease).	Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a group of diseases characterized by mean pulmonary artery pressure >20 mmHg and elevated pulmonary arterial resistance leading to right heart failure. PAH is progressive and potentially fatal. PAH may be idiopathic and/ or familial, have overt features of venous/capillary involvement (pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, PVOD/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis, PCH), induced by drug or toxin (drug-or toxin-induced PAH), or associated with other diseases like congenital heart disease, connective tissue disease, HIV, schistosomiasis, portal hypertension (PAH associated with other disease).
MONDO:0008572	definition		Tibial hemimelia-polysyndactyly-triphalangeal thumb syndrome is a rare, genetic dysostosis syndrome, with marked inter- and intra-familial variation, typically characterized by triphalangeal thumbs, hand and/or foot polysyndactyly and/or absent/hypoplastic tibiae (associated with duplication of fibulae in some cases), although isolated triphalangeal thumbs have also been reported. It is often accompanied with remarkable short stature and additional features may include radio-ulnar synostosis and hand oligodactyly, as well as abnormal carpal and metatarsal bones.
MONDO:0008952	definition	Cerebro-facio-thoracic dysplasia or Pascual-Castroviejo syndrome type 1 is a rare syndrome characterized by facial dysmorphism, intellectual deficit and costovertebral abnormalities.	
MONDO:0018554	definition	Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and/or pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PVOD and/or PCH) constitutes a rare subgroup of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) characterized by obliterative fibrosis of the small pulmonary veins and venules and/or capillary infiltration of the pulmonary interstitium leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular dysfunction.	A rare subgroup of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) characterized by obliterative fibrosis of the small pulmonary veins and venules and/or capillary infiltration of the pulmonary interstitium leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular dysfunction.
MONDO:0009700	definition	Carey-Fineman-Ziter (CFZ) syndrome is a rare condition characterized by the association of hypotonia, Moebius sequence (bilateral congenital facial palsy with impairment of ocular abduction), Pierre-Robin sequence (micrognathia, glossoptosis, and high-arched or cleft palate), unusual face, and growth delay.	
MONDO:0012017	definition	Parkes Weber syndrome (PWS) is a rare congenital condition characterized by a large number of abnormal blood vessels.The main signs and symptoms of PWS typically include a capillary malformation on the skin; hypertrophy (excessive growth) ofthe bone and soft tissue of the affected limb; and multiple arteriovenousfistulas (abnormal connections between arteries and veins) which canpotentially lead to heart failure. There also may be pain in the affected limb and a difference in size between the limbs. Some cases of Parkes Weber syndrome result from mutations inthe RASA1 gene, andare inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In these cases, affected people usually have multiple capillary malformations. People with PWS without multiple capillary malformations are unlikely to have mutations in the RASA1 gene; in these cases, the cause of the condition is often unknown. Management typically depends on the presence and severity of symptoms and may includeembolization or surgery in the affected limb.	
MONDO:0019053	definition	A group of congenital disorders of lipid metabolism, caused by loss of the normal peroxisomes. Signs and symptoms include developmental delays, mental retardation, facial abnormalities, hepatomegaly, and hypotonia.	A group of congenital disorders of lipid metabolism, caused by loss of the normal peroxisomes. Signs and symptoms include developmental delays, intellectual disability, characteristic facial dysmorphic features, hepatomegaly, and hypotonia.
MONDO:0018052	definition	Hypoplastic tibia-polydactyly syndrome is a very rare congenital malformation syndrome characterized by bilateral hypoplasia of the tibia with polydactyly of the feet and hands.	
MONDO:0019409	definition	Idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis (IJO) is a primary condition of bone demineralization that presents with pain in the back and extremities, walking difficulties, multiple fractures, and radiological evidence of osteoporosis.	Idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis (IJO) is a primary condition of bone demineralization childhood or adolescence that presents with pain in the back and extremities, walking difficulties, multiple fractures, and radiological evidence of osteoporosis. Onset usually occurs in the prepubertal period, between 8 and 12 years of age.
MONDO:0020306	definition	Tibial hemimelia-polysyndactyly-triphalangeal thumb syndrome is a rare, genetic dysostosis syndrome, with marked inter- and intra-familial variation, typically characterized by triphalangeal thumbs, hand and/or foot polysyndactyly and/or absent/hypoplastic tibiae (associated with duplication of fibulae in some cases), although isolated triphalangeal thumbs have also been reported.
