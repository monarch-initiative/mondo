MONDO:0012279	definition	The congenital muscle dystrophies are currently classified according to the genetic defects. Historically, congenital muscular dystrophies were classified in two broad groups: Classic CMD (which included the Merosin-deficient CMD and the Merosin-positive CMD) and the CMD with central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities (Fukuyama CMD, muscle-eye-brain disease and Walker-Warburg syndrome). Therefore, merosin-positive congenital muscle dystrophy (CMD) is now considered an old term which refers to a group of diseases without structural brain abnormalities that are caused by a variety of gene mutations, resulting in protein defects that do not affect the merosin protein.

MONDO:0019536	definition	Typical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (typical HUS) is a thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by mechanical hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal dysfunction that is usually associated with prodromal enteritis caused by Shigella dysentriae type 1 or E. Coli.

MONDO:0044688	definition		A rare inflammatory optic neuropathy characterized by isolated episodes (either single or recurrent) of optic neuritis not associated with other neurological or systemic disease. Patients typically present with subacute unilateral loss of vision progressing over several days to two weeks, periocular pain and pain on eye movement (which may precede the onset of visual symptoms), light flashes on eye movement, abnormal color vision, reduced contrast sensitivity, and relative afferent pupillary defect. The optic disc appears swollen in many patients, and uveitis may be associated and can be present for years before the onset of optic neuritis.
MONDO:0044687	definition		A rare inflammatory optic neuropathy characterized by severe and persistent pain followed by subacute visual loss, a relapsing-remitting course, and steroid-dependence. Involvement of both optic nerves is common and is usually sequential. Serum antibodies against aquaporin 4 are absent in most cases. Magnetic resonance imaging shows contrast enhancement of the acutely inflamed optic nerves.
MONDO:0044689	definition		A rare inflammatory optic neuropathy characterized by recurrent episodes of idiopathic inflammation of the optic nerve head with optic disc edema associated with macular exudate in a star-shaped pattern. Patients present with acute visual loss, most typically in the form of a large central scotoma. Pain is mild or absent. Bilateral involvement is frequent and usually sequential. The interval between attacks is highly variable, ranging from months to several years. Visual loss is cumulative with each attack and often severe.
MONDO:0044690	definition		A rare ophthalmic disorder characterized by idiopathic orbital inflammation in which the specific target tissue is the optic nerve sheath. Patients typically present with ocular pain, pain on eye movement, visual symptoms with loss of vision progressing over several weeks, dyschromatopsia, and variable visual field defects. Orbital signs and symptoms may be present and include ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and exophthalmos. Optic disc edema is observed in most cases. The condition is usually unilateral.
MONDO:0100300	definition	An instance of capillary infantine hemangioma that is caused by an inherited genomic modification in an individual.
