MONDO:0000160	definition	An adolescence-adult electroclinical syndrome characterized by adult-onset cortical myoclonus typically first seen as tremulous finger movements and myoclonus of the extremities.	An epilepsy syndrome characterized by adult-onset cortical myoclonus typically first seen as tremulous finger movements and myoclonus of the extremities.
MONDO:0000411	definition	An epilepsy syndrome that is a group of clinical entities showing a cluster of electro-clinical characteristics, classified according to age at onset, cognitive and developmental antecedents and consequences, motor and sensory examinations, EEG features, provoking or triggering factors, and patterns of seizure occurrence with respect to sleep.	OBSOLETE. An epilepsy syndrome that is a group of clinical entities showing a cluster of electro-clinical characteristics, classified according to age at onset, cognitive and developmental antecedents and consequences, motor and sensory examinations, EEG features, provoking or triggering factors, and patterns of seizure occurrence with respect to sleep.
MONDO:0100030	definition	An epilepsy syndrome that has an onset during the adolescent or adult stage of life.	OBSOLETE. An epilepsy syndrome that has an onset during the adolescent or adult stage of life.
MONDO:0018637	definition		A rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by the buildup in the blood of fat particles called chylomicrons (chylomicronemia), severe hypertriglyceridemia, and the risk of recurrent and potentially fatal pancreatitis and other complications. It is caused by mutations in the gene encoding LPL or, less frequently, by mutations in genes encoding other proteins necessary for LPL function.
MONDO:0850093	definition	An electroclinical syndrome characterized by the occurrence of generalized onset seizures that cause lapses in awareness, begin and end abruptly, typically last only a few seconds and are associated with abnormal spike-wave discharges as seen by electroencephalogram.	OBSOLETE. An electroclinical syndrome characterized by the occurrence of generalized onset seizures that cause lapses in awareness, begin and end abruptly, typically last only a few seconds and are associated with abnormal spike-wave discharges as seen by electroencephalogram.
MONDO:0016025	definition	A rare epilepsy syndrome of childhood characterized by the occurrence of multiple different seizure types including myoclonic-astatic, generalized tonic-clonic and absence seizures, usually in previously healthy children.	
MONDO:0015470	definition	OBSOLETE. Familial isolated dilated cardiomyopathy is a rare, genetically heterogeneous cardiac disease characterized by dilatation leading to systolic and diastolic dysfunction of the left and/or right ventricles, causing heart failure or arrhythmia.	
MONDO:0020307	definition	A rare, genetic neurological disorder characterized by late infancy to early-adolescence onset of prolonged, nocturnal seizures which begin with autonomic features (e.g. vomiting, pallor, sweating) and associate tonic eye deviation, impairment of consciousness and may evolve to a hemi-clonic or generalized convulsion. Autonomic status epilepticus may be the only clinical event in some cases.	A childhood-onset self-limited focal epilepsy syndrome characterized by the onset in early childhood of focal autonomic seizures that are often prolonged. The EEG commonly shows high amplitude focal spikes typically activated by sleep. Seizures are infrequent in most patients. Seizures are self-limiting with remission typically within a few years from onset.
MONDO:0034099	definition	A rare genetic developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) characterized by developmental delay, generalized epilepsy consisting of eyelid myoclonia with absences and myoclonic-atonic seizures, intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD).	
MONDO:0060622	definition	A complex neurodevelopmental disorder caused by variation in DHX30. Individuals with variants in DHX30 have been found to have variable presentations including intellectual development, delayed or absent speech development, delayed motor development, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and ataxic gait or the inability to walk. Other phenotypic features commonly reported include sleep disorders, autistic features, seizures, and joint hypermobility	A complex neurodevelopmental disorder caused by variation in DHX30.

MONDO:0100031	definition	A genetic focal epilepsy, with focal sensory auditory seizures seen in family members. Seizures often comprise such mild symptoms that they are undiagnosed. There are no implications expected for development or learning and seizures are typically infrequent and well controlled.	
MONDO:1011672	definition		A gestational disease affecting pregnant animals characterized by excessive accumulation of fluid within the allantoic cavity and associated with fetal and placental abnormalities and fetal mortality.
MONDO:1011928	definition		A respiratory disorder characterized by an inability to abduct the arytenoid cartilages during inspiration resulting in a partial to complete airway obstruction and consequent respiratory distress.
