MONDO:0004369	definition		An infectious disease that involves the kidney.
MONDO:0800180	definition	Any inherited porphyria in which the cause of the disease is monoallelic or biallelic variants in the CPOX gene.	A porphyria caused by monoallelic and biallelic variants in CPOX and presenting as a spectrum of disease (a semidominant inheritance pattern). Monoallelic variants typically cause acute/episodic neurovisceral attacks with adolescent or adult onset, characterized by severe abdominal pain as well as acute motor neuropathy and other neurological symptoms. Triggers precipitating acute attacks include estrogen/progesterone, oral contraceptives, alcohol, drugs, stress, or infections. Cases with biallelic variants have symptoms in infancy, including hemolytic anemia, enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), and severe jaundice. Additional symptoms may include erythrodontia, red urine, fragile skin, and cutaneous photosensitivity leading to scarring of sun-exposed skin.
MONDO:0100498	definition	Any inherited porphyria in which the cause of the disease is monoallelic or biallelic variants in the UROD gene.	Porphyria caused by monoallelic and biallelic variants in UROD and presenting as a spectrum of disease (a semidominant inheritance pattern). Additionally, environmental factors almost always play a role in the disease. Monoallelic variants when exacerbated by environmental factors can result in episodic adult onset of photosensitivity. Biallelic variants that reduce WT enzyme activity <20% cause childhood onset of photosensitivity and sometimes liver damage.
MONDO:0008319	definition	Erythropoietic protoporphyria caused by a compound heterozygous or homozygous mutation in the gene encoding ferrochelatase (FECH) on chromosome 18q21.	An erythropoietic protoporphyria caused by biallelic variants in FECH (an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern) and causing primarily accumulation of protoporphyrin IX. Symptoms include extremely painful photosensitivity in childhood, possible microcytic anemia, cholelithiasis, and ~5% of patients develop liver failure. The majority of individuals with FECH-related erythropoietic protoporphyria harbor a hypomorphic variant (NM_000140.5:c.315-48T>C), which reduces enzyme levels by ~35%, in trans to a second pathogenic variant. Clinically individuals with this form of porphyria cannot be distinguished from those with ALAS2-related erythropoietic protoporphyria.
MONDO:0009902	definition	Congenital erythropoietic porphyria, or Günther disease, is a form of erythropoietic porphyria characterized by very severe and mutilating photodermatosis.	An erythropoietic porphyria (massive accumulation of photoreactive porphyrins in the bone marrow erythroid cells and circulating erythrocytes, resulting in cutaneous photosensitivity) caused by biallelic variants in UROS (in an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern). Cases where biallelic variants reduce WT enzyme activity to <5% are characterized by photosensitivity, hemolytic anemia (often in utero), erythrodontia, splenomegaly, cutaneous blistering, scarring and disfigurement. Other cases where biallelic variants do not reduce enzyme activity as severely (5-12% of WT activity) have a later onset of photosensitivity and milder symptoms.
MONDO:1040039	definition	Any ciliopathy caused by monoallelic, biallelic, or hemizygous variants in the OFD1 gene.	Any ciliopathy caused by monoallelic, biallelic, or hemizygous variants in the OFD1 gene. This disease is characterized by a broad range of phenotypes including Joubert syndrome, orofaciodigital syndrome, retinitis pigmentosa, and primary ciliary dyskinesia.
MONDO:0010420	definition	X-linked form of erythropoietic protoporphyria.	An erythropoietic protoporphyria in which the cause of the disease is a hemizygous, heterozygous, or homozygous (rare) gain-of-function (GOF) variant (X-linked inheritance pattern) in the terminal regulatory exon of ALAS2. GOF variants increase ALAS2 activity resulting in pathway upregulation and high levels of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX). Males with hemizygous variants frequently present in early childhood with severe cutaneous photosensitivity and laboratory markers of liver disease. Heterozygous females can present with symptoms ranging from as severe as affected males to asymptomatic due to random X-chromosome inactivation. This disease is clinically indistinguishable from FECH-related erythropoietic protoporphyria.
MONDO:0011068	definition	An inherited susceptibility or predisposition to developing type 1 diabetes mellitus in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the CTLA4 gene.	
MONDO:0011215	definition	Osteocraniostenosis is a lethal skeletal dysplasia characterized by a cloverleaf skull anomaly, facial dysmorphism, limb shortness, splenic hypo/aplasia and radiological anomalies including thin tubular bones with flared metaphyses and deficient calvarial mineralization.	A lethal skeletal dysplasia characterized by a cloverleaf skull anomaly, facial dysmorphism, limb shortness, splenic hypo/aplasia and radiological anomalies including thin tubular bones with flared metaphyses and deficient calvarial mineralization.
MONDO:0011628	definition	Propionic acidemia (PA) is an organic aciduria caused by the deficient activity of the propionyl Coenzyme A carboxylase and is characterized by life threatening episodes of metabolic decompensation, neurological dysfunction and that may be complicated by cardiomyopathy.	An organic aciduria caused by the deficient activity of the propionyl Coenzyme A carboxylase and is characterized by life threatening episodes of metabolic decompensation, neurological dysfunction and that may be complicated by cardiomyopathy.
MONDO:0012341	definition	Any celiac disease in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the CTLA4 gene.	
MONDO:0012969	definition	Any microvascular complications of diabetes, susceptibility in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the PON1 gene.	
MONDO:0013000	definition	An extremely rare form of acute hepatic porphyria characterized by neuro-visceral attacks without cutaneous manifestations.	A hepatic porphyria caused by biallelic variants in ALAD (in an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern). This is an extremely rare form of hepatic porphyria characterized by neuro-visceral attacks, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, neuropathy, and abdominal pain without cutaneous manifestations. Because the disease is so rare, inducible triggers are not well-documented.
MONDO:0013731	definition		A congenital myopathy caused by mutations in the multiple epidermal growth factor-like domains 10 (MEGF10) gene, which causes early-onset myopathy characterized by severe weakness, scoliosis, joint contractures, areflexia, respiratory distress, and dysphagia, and a milder phenotype of minicore myopathy.
MONDO:0014391	definition	Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) due to CTPS1 deficiency is a rare primary immunodeficiency disorder due to impaired capacity of activated T- and B-cells to proliferate in response to antigen receptor-mediated activation characterized by early-onset, severe, persistent and/or recurrent viral infections due to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Varicella Zoster virus (VZV), (including generalized varicella), as well as recurrent sino-pulmonary bacterial infections due to encapsulated pathogens.

MONDO:0017147	definition	Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is a sporadic form of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) characterized by elevated pulmonary arterial resistance leading to right heart failure. IPAH is progressive and potentially fatal and not associated with an underlying condition or family history of PAH.	
MONDO:0019415	definition	Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAIT) is a blood disorder that affects pregnant women and their babies. NAIT was first reported in the literature in 1953 and is estimated to occur in as many as 1 in 1200 live births. NAIT results in the destruction of platelets in the fetus or infant due to a mismatch between the mother's platelets and those of the baby. Certain molecules (antigens) on the surface of the baby's platelets are recognized as foreign by the mother's immune system. The mother's immune system then creates antibodies that attack and destroy the baby's platelets. Though NAIT can occur whenever the mother's blood mixes with that of the baby, it is usually triggered when the mother is exposed to the baby's blood during delivery. Many cases of NAIT are mild. Signs and symptoms may include a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and signs of bleeding into the skin such as petechiae and purpura. In the most severe cases, NAIT can cause bleeding episodes that may result in death or long-term disability. Bleeding episodes can occur either during pregnancy or after birth. Management of the infant with neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia may include platelet transfusions, ultrasounds, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Treatment for pregnant mothers at risk for NAIT may include IVIG and steroids.	A rare hematological disease characterized by maternal alloimmunisation against fetal platelet antigens that are inherited from the father and different from those present in the mother, and usually presents as a severe isolated thrombocytopenia in otherwise healthy newborns.
MONDO:0020737	definition		An optic atrophy caused by a variation in the RTN4IP1; the optic atrophy can be associated with neurological involvement, including intellectual disability, ataxia, seizures.
MONDO:0035122	definition	A rare genetic syndromic intellectual disability in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the GRIN2B gene. It is characterized by infantile or childhood onset of mild to profound developmental delay and intellectual disability in all affected individuals, as well as variable occurrence of epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder / behavioral issues, microcephaly, muscle tone abnormalities such as hypotonia and spasticity, dystonic, dyskinetic, or choreiform movement disorder, and cortical visual impairment. Brain MRI may reveal abnormal cortical development, hypoplastic corpus callosum, enlarged/dysplastic basal ganglia, and hippocampal dysplasia.
