MONDO:0015746	definition	Male infertility due to globozoospermia is a male infertility due to sperm disorder characterized by the presence, in sperm, of a large majority of round-headed spermatozoa that lack the acrosome and have an aberrant nuclear membrane and midpiece defects. The acrosomeless spermatozoa is not able to penetrate the zona pellucida and thus fertilization failures, even with intracytoplasmic spem injection, are frequent.	A male infertility due to sperm disorder characterized by the presence, in sperm, of a large majority of round-headed spermatozoa that lack the acrosome and have an aberrant nuclear membrane and midpiece defects. The acrosomeless spermatozoa is not able to penetrate the zona pellucida following intercourse or IVF thus fertilization fails. Fertilization efficiency is also very low following intracytoplasmic spem injection due to the absence of the oocyte activation factor protein PLCzeta.
MONDO:0009461	definition	Male infertility due to large-headed multiflagellar polypoid spermatozoa is a male infertility due to sperm disorder characterized by the presence, in sperm, of a very high percentage of spermatozoa with enlarged head, irregular head shape, multiple flagella, and abnormal midpiece and acrosome. It is generally associated with severe oligoasthenozoospermia and a high rate of sperm chromosomal abnormalities (polyploidy, aneuploidy).	A male infertility due to sperm disorder characterized by the presence, in sperm, of a very high percentage of spermatozoa with enlarged head, irregular head shape, multiple flagella, and abnormal midpiece and acrosome. It is generally associated with severe oligoasthenozoospermia and a high rate of sperm chromosomal abnormalities (polyploidy, aneuploidy).
MONDO:0010483	definition	X-linked Mental retardation Cantagrel type is characterized by marked neonatal hypotonia, progressive quadriparesia, severely delayed developmental milestones (walking at 3 years of age), gastroesophageal reflux, stereotypic movements of the hands, esotropia and infantile autism.	An X-linked syndromic intellectual disability characterized by marked neonatal hypotonia, progressive quadriparesia, severely delayed developmental milestones (walking at 3 years of age), gastroesophageal reflux, stereotypic movements of the hands, esotropia and infantile autism.
MONDO:0100080	definition	Cardioectodermal syndromes are those in which phenotypic manifestations occur in the heart, skin, and/or hair. Variation in the genes of interest may occur in both an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, or in an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern which may result in an earlier and/or more severe phenotypic presentation.	A syndromic disease with phenotypic manifestations in the heart, skin, and/or hair. Variation in the genes of interest may occur in both an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, or in an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern which may result in an earlier and/or more severe phenotypic presentation.
MONDO:0018013	definition		A rare primary membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis characterized by complement dysregulation occurring in the fluid phase and in the glomerular microenvironment, which results in prominent complement C3 deposition in kidney biopsy samples.
MONDO:0012398	definition		Any achromatopsia caused by a mutation in the PDE6H gene, characterized by incomplete loss of color vision, with a red-green color vision defect and normal or near-normal blue-yellow vision. Reduced visual acuity is also present, but not progressive.
MONDO:0012727	definition	Kawasaki disease (KD) is a febrile, systemic, self-limiting vasculitis affecting children and characterized by inflammation in the medium sized vessels associated with coronary arterial aneurysms (CAA) that may be life threatening when untreated. KD is the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed countries and is a risk factor for ischemic heart disease in adulthood.	A rare inflammatory disease characterized by an acute febrile, systemic, self-limiting, medium-vessel vasculitis primarily affecting children. It often causes acute coronary arteritis which is associated with coronary arterial aneurysms (CAA) that may be life threatening when untreated.
MONDO:0013293	definition	Any isolated microphthalmia in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the PRSS56 gene.	Any isolated microphthalmia in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the PRSS56 gene. This disease includes cases diagnosed as microphthalmos (specifically as posterior microphthalmos) and nanophthalmos.
MONDO:0014306	definition	Vasculitis due to ADA2 deficiency is a rare, genetic, systemic and rheumatologic disease due to adenosine deaminase-2 inactivating mutations, combining variable features of autoinflammation, vasculitis, and a mild immunodeficiency. Variable clinical presentation includes chronic or recurrent systemic inflammation with fever, livedo reticularis or racemosa, early-onset ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes, peripheral neuropathy, abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly, portal hypertension, cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa, variable cytopenia and immunoglobulin deficiency.	A rare autoinflammatory disease characterized by a broad clinical phenotype of systemic inflammation, vasculitis, early-onset stroke, immunodeficiency and bone marrow failure. The disease typically presents in young children, although adult cases are being discovered.
MONDO:0018146	definition	A rare, acquired, eye disease characterized by unilateral (rarely bilateral) abnormally dilated and tortuous capillaries around the fovea, associated with multiple arteriolar and venular aneurysms, lipid depositions, and intra-retinal cystoid degeneration. It leads to vision loss due to macular edema with hard exudates.	A rare, acquired, macular telangiectasia characterized by unilateral (rarely bilateral) abnormally dilated and tortuous capillaries around the fovea, associated with multiple arteriolar and venular aneurysms, lipid depositions, and intra-retinal cystoid degeneration. It leads to vision loss due to macular edema with hard exudates.
MONDO:0018147	definition	A rare, acquired, eye disease characterized by progressive visual loss, due to bilateral juxtafoveolar capillary occlusions, capillary telangiectasia, and minimal exudation. It is associated with systemic or cerebral vascular occlusive disease.	A rare, acquired, macular telangiectasia characterized by progressive visual loss, due to bilateral juxtafoveolar capillary occlusions, capillary telangiectasia, and minimal exudation. It is associated with systemic or cerebral vascular occlusive disease.
MONDO:0019736	definition	Dense deposit disease, a histological subtype of MPGN is an idiopathic chronic progressive kidney disorder distinguished by the presence of intra-membranous dense deposits in addition to immune complex subendothelial deposits in the glomerular capillary walls. This form often has a higher recurrence rate after a kidney transplant and is associated with extra-renal manifestations such as familial drusen.	A histological subtype of C3 glomerulopathy characterized by C3 deposition in renal tissue in the absence or near-absence of immunoglobulin deposits, in a patient with the classic clinical features of glomerulonephritis and electron microscopic findings of highly electron-dense intra-membranous, osmiophilic deposits.
MONDO:0100317	definition	Any disease or disorder in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the ADA2 gene.	
MONDO:0971179	definition		A syndromic disease with a spectrum of manifestations in the cardiovascular system and other organ systems caused by disease-causing variants in the EMILIN1 gene, inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Affected individuals have impaired elastogenesis with defective collagen fibrillogenesis which can lead to arterial tortuosity, bone fragility and other manifestations including dysmorphic facial features, cutis laxa, joint hypermobility, congenital heart malformations, arterial stenosis, and aortic root dilatation. Cases may present prenatally or in early childhood.
