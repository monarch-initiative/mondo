MONDO:0001999	definition	Increased blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs; the etiology is unknown.	A sporadic form of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) characterized by elevated pulmonary arterial resistance leading to right heart failure. IPAH is progressive and potentially fatal and not associated with an underlying condition or family history of PAH. The etiology is unknown.

MONDO:0011215	definition	Osteocraniostenosis is a lethal skeletal dysplasia characterized by a cloverleaf skull anomaly, facial dysmorphism, limb shortness, splenic hypo/aplasia and radiological anomalies including thin tubular bones with flared metaphyses and deficient calvarial mineralization.	A lethal skeletal dysplasia characterized by a cloverleaf skull anomaly, facial dysmorphism, limb shortness, splenic hypo/aplasia and radiological anomalies including thin tubular bones with flared metaphyses and deficient calvarial mineralization.
MONDO:0011628	definition	Propionic acidemia (PA) is an organic aciduria caused by the deficient activity of the propionyl Coenzyme A carboxylase and is characterized by life threatening episodes of metabolic decompensation, neurological dysfunction and that may be complicated by cardiomyopathy.	An organic aciduria caused by the deficient activity of the propionyl Coenzyme A carboxylase and is characterized by life threatening episodes of metabolic decompensation, neurological dysfunction and that may be complicated by cardiomyopathy.
MONDO:0014391	definition	Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) due to CTPS1 deficiency is a rare primary immunodeficiency disorder due to impaired capacity of activated T- and B-cells to proliferate in response to antigen receptor-mediated activation characterized by early-onset, severe, persistent and/or recurrent viral infections due to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Varicella Zoster virus (VZV), (including generalized varicella), as well as recurrent sino-pulmonary bacterial infections due to encapsulated pathogens.	Rare primary immunodeficiency disorder due to impaired capacity of activated T- and B-cells to proliferate in response to antigen receptor-mediated activation characterized by early-onset, persistent and/or recurrent viral infections due to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Varicella Zoster virus (VZV), (including generalized varicella), as well as recurrent sino-pulmonary bacterial infections due to encapsulated pathogens.
MONDO:0017147	definition	Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is a sporadic form of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) characterized by elevated pulmonary arterial resistance leading to right heart failure. IPAH is progressive and potentially fatal and not associated with an underlying condition or family history of PAH.	
MONDO:0020737	definition		An optic atrophy caused by a variation in the RTN4IP1; the optic atrophy can be associated with neurological involvement, including intellectual disability, ataxia, seizures.
MONDO:0035122	definition	A rare genetic syndromic intellectual disability in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the GRIN2B gene. It is characterized by infantile or childhood onset of mild to profound developmental delay and intellectual disability in all affected individuals, as well as variable occurrence of epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder / behavioral issues, microcephaly, muscle tone abnormalities such as hypotonia and spasticity, dystonic, dyskinetic, or choreiform movement disorder, and cortical visual impairment. Brain MRI may reveal abnormal cortical development, hypoplastic corpus callosum, enlarged/dysplastic basal ganglia, and hippocampal dysplasia.
