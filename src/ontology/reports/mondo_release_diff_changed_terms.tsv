MONDO:0012017	definition	Parkes Weber syndrome (PWS) is a rare congenital condition characterized by a large number of abnormal blood vessels.The main signs and symptoms of PWS typically include a capillary malformation on the skin; hypertrophy (excessive growth) ofthe bone and soft tissue of the affected limb; and multiple arteriovenousfistulas (abnormal connections between arteries and veins) which canpotentially lead to heart failure.
