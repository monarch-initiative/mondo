MONDO:0006547	definition	Any change in the skin which affects its appearance or texture. A rash may be localized to one part of the body, or affect all the skin.

MONDO:0008206	definition	Benign paroxysmal tonic upgaze of childhood with ataxia is a rare paroxysmal movement disorder characterized by episodes of sustained, conjugate, upward deviation of the eyes and down beating saccades in attempted downgaze (with preserved horizontal eye movements) which is accompanied by ataxic symptomatology (unsteady gait, lack of balance and movement coordination disturbances) in an otherwise healthy individual. Bilateral vertical nystagmus is associated. Symptoms generally disappear spontaneously within 1-2 years after onset.

MONDO:0018394	definition	Male infertility with teratozoospermia due to single gene mutation is a rare, genetic male infertility due to sperm disorder characterized by the presence of spermatozoa with abnormal morphology, such as macrozoospermia or globozoospermia, in over 85% of sperm, resulting from mutation in a single gene known to cause teratozoospermia. It is a heterogeneous group that includes a wide range of abnormal sperm phenotypes affecting, solely or simultaneously, head, neck, midpiece, and/or tail.

MONDO:0044328	definition	Short-rib thoracic dysplasia (SRTD) with or without polydactyly refers to a group of autosomal recessive skeletal ciliopathies that are characterized by a constricted thoracic cage, short ribs, shortened tubular bones, and a 'trident' appearance of the acetabular roof. SRTD encompasses Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (EVC) and the disorders previously designated as Jeune syndrome or asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (ATD), short rib-polydactyly syndrome (SRPS), and Mainzer-Saldino syndrome (MZSDS). Polydactyly is variably present, and there is phenotypic overlap in the various forms of SRTDs, which differ by visceral malformation and metaphyseal appearance. Nonskeletal involvement can include cleft lip/palate as well as anomalies of major organs such as the brain, eye, heart, kidneys, liver, pancreas, intestines, and genitalia. Some forms of SRTD are lethal in the neonatal period due to respiratory insufficiency secondary to a severely restricted thoracic cage, whereas others are compatible with life (summary by {1:Huber and Cormier-Daire, 2012} and {2:Schmidts et al., 2013}).nnThere is phenotypic overlap with the cranioectodermal dysplasias (Sensenbrenner syndrome; see CED1, OMIM:218330).	A group of autosomal recessive skeletal ciliopathies that are characterized by a constricted thoracic cage, short ribs, shortened tubular bones, and a 'trident' appearance of the acetabular roof.
MONDO:0971007	definition		A neuroocular syndrome caused by a mutation in PRR12 gene. It encompasses a broad spectrum of overlapping anomalies, with developmental delay or impaired intellectual development as a consistent finding. Eye abnormalities show marked variability in the type and severity of defects, and include anophthalmia, microphthalmia, and coloboma. Other common systemic features include congenital heart and kidney defects, hypotonia, failure to thrive, and microcephaly.
