MONDO:0008332	definition	Platelet type Von Willebrand disease (PT-VWD) is a bleeding disorder characterized by mild to moderate mucocutaneous bleeding, which becomes more pronounced during pregnancy or following ingestion of drugs that have anti-platelet activity.

PT-VWD is due to hyperresponsive platelets, resulting in thrombocytopenia.
MONDO:0015924	definition	Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a group of diseases characterized by elevated pulmonary arterial resistance leading to right heart failure. PAH is progressive and potentially fatal.

MONDO:0008572	definition		Tibial hemimelia-polysyndactyly-triphalangeal thumb syndrome is a rare, genetic dysostosis syndrome, with marked inter- and intra-familial variation, typically characterized by triphalangeal thumbs, hand and/or foot polysyndactyly and/or absent/hypoplastic tibiae (associated with duplication of fibulae in some cases), although isolated triphalangeal thumbs have also been reported. It is often accompanied with remarkable short stature and additional features may include radio-ulnar synostosis and hand oligodactyly, as well as abnormal carpal and metatarsal bones.
MONDO:0017905	definition	X-linked (XR) Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD) describes a rare group of immunodeficiencies due to specific mutations in the inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells, kinase gamma (IKBKG) or the cytochrome b-245, beta polypeptide (CYBB) genes. They are characterized by mycobacterial infections, occuring in males.	A rare group of immunodeficiencies due to specific mutations in the inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells, kinase gamma (IKBKG) or the cytochrome b-245, beta polypeptide (CYBB) genes. They are characterized by mycobacterial infections, occuring in males.
MONDO:0012017	definition	Parkes Weber syndrome (PWS) is a rare congenital condition characterized by a large number of abnormal blood vessels.The main signs and symptoms of PWS typically include a capillary malformation on the skin; hypertrophy (excessive growth) ofthe bone and soft tissue of the affected limb; and multiple arteriovenousfistulas (abnormal connections between arteries and veins) which canpotentially lead to heart failure. There also may be pain in the affected limb and a difference in size between the limbs. Some cases of Parkes Weber syndrome result from mutations inthe RASA1 gene, andare inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In these cases, affected people usually have multiple capillary malformations. People with PWS without multiple capillary malformations are unlikely to have mutations in the RASA1 gene; in these cases, the cause of the condition is often unknown. Management typically depends on the presence and severity of symptoms and may includeembolization or surgery in the affected limb.
