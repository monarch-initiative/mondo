MONDO:0060627	definition		A rare, genetic, syndromic intellectual disability characterized by global developmental delay, early-onset seizures, cerebellar atrophy, osteopenia, nystagmus and dysmorphic facial features, including bitemporal narrowing, prominent forehead, anteverted nares.

MONDO:0100023	definition	A neonatal/infantile epilepsy sndrome that is characterized by the onset of seizures that start in the in the neonate between day 4 and 7 of life and are often unilateral clonic events that recur and may alternate sides from seizure to seizure. Seizures can be repetitive over hours to days. Seizures remit by 4-6 months of age. A proportion of those affected may have seizures in later life. The child is expected to have normal developmental progress.	A neonatal/infantile epilepsy syndrome that is characterized by the onset of seizures that start in the in the neonate between day 1 and 7 of life and are often unilateral clonic events that recur and may alternate sides from seizure to seizure. Seizures can be repetitive over hours to days. Seizures remit by 4-6 months of age. A proportion of those affected may have seizures in later life. The child is expected to have typical developmental progress.
MONDO:0100296	definition	Mutilating palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK) with periorificial keratotic plaques (also known as Olmsted syndrome) is a hereditary palmoplantar keratoderma characterized by the combination of bilateral mutilating transgredient palmoplantar keratoderma and periorificial keratotic plaques.	Any Olmsted syndrome in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the TRPV3 gene.
MONDO:0700123	definition	Any BAFopathy in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the SMARCC1 gene.	Variants in SMARCC1 cause a novel human syndrome characterized by developmental delay, cerebral ventriculomegaly and aqueductal stenosis, and other associated structural brain and cardiac defects.
