name: cell
def: "A material entity of anatomical origin (part of or deriving from an organism) that has as its parts a maximally connected cell compartment surrounded by a plasma membrane." [CARO:mah]
comment: The definition of cell is intended to represent all cells, and thus a cell is defined as a material entity and not an anatomical structure, which implies that it is part of an organism (or the entirety of one).

def: "A cell that is found in a natural setting, which includes multicellular organism cells 'in vivo' (i.e. part of an organism), and unicellular organisms 'in environment' (i.e. part of a natural environment)." [CARO:mah]
comment: To accommodate unicellular organisms better, 'cell in vivo' has been re-labeled 'native cell' to better represent its intended meaning - that is, that it is a cell in the context of a multicellular organism or in a natural environment. 'Native' is intended to contrast with 'in vitro', which refers to cells or other biological entities that have been intentionally placed in a controlled, non-natural setting for the purpose of study or manipulation.

def: "A cell that is found in almost all tissues containing numerous basophilic granules and capable of releasing large amounts of histamine and heparin upon activation. Progenitors leave bone marrow and mature in connective and mucosal tissue. Mature mast cells are found in all tissues, except the bloodstream. Their phenotype is CD117-high, CD123-negative, CD193-positive, CD200R3-positive, and FceRI-high. Stem-cell factor (KIT-ligand; SCF) is the main controlling signal of their survival and development."

comment: Mast cells are generally integrin beta-7-negative and positive for TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7, TLR9, C3aR, C5aR, CR3, CR4, VEGF, FGF2, and renin. They can express MHC Class I and II on their surface. Activated murine mast cells (IgE+Antigen) were capable of expressing the following co-stimulatory molecules: CD95 (Fas), CD120b, CD137 (4-1BB), CD153 (CD30L), CD154 (CD40L), GITR, ICOSL, OX40L, PD-L1, and PD-L2. Note that there was some mouse strain variation. Mast cells have also been demonstrated to produce bFGF, CCL2, CCL4, CCL5, CCL11, CCL20, CXCL2, CXCL8, CXCL10, GM-CSF, IFN-gamma, IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-8, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12, IL-13, IL-16, IL-25, IL-18, MIP-1, prostaglandin D2, SCF, TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, TSLP, VEGF, and XCL1. They express the transcription factors Transcription factors AP-1, GATA1, MITF, Notch2, PIAS3, PU.1, and STAT5.

comment: From FMA: 9.07.2001: Endothelial cell has always been classified as a kind of epithelial cell, specifically a squamous cell but that is not true. First, endothelial cell can either be squamous or cuboidal (e.g. high-endothelial cell) and secondly, it has different embryological derivation (mesodermal) than a true epithelial cell (ectodermal and endodermal). The basis for present classification is the fact that it comprises the outermost layer or lining of anatomical structures (location-based) but a better structural basis for the differentia is the cytoskeleton of the cell. Endothelial cell has vimentin filaments while an epithelial cell has keratin filaments. [Onard].

def: "Cardiac muscle cells are striated muscle cells that are responsible for heart contraction. In mammals, the contractile fiber resembles those of skeletal muscle but are only one third as large in diameter, are richer in sarcoplasm, and contain centrally located instead of peripheral nuclei." [GOC:mtg_cardiacconduct_nov11, GOC:tfm, ISBN:0323052908, PMID:22426062, PMID:4711263]
comment: This class encompasses the muscle cells responsible for heart* contraction in both vertebrates and arthropods.  The ultrastucture of a wide range of arthropod heart cells has been examined including spiders, horseshoe crabs, crustaceans (see Sherman, 1973 and refs therein) and insects (see Lehmacher et al (2012) and refs therein).  According to these refs, the cells participating in heart contraction in all cases are transversely striated.  Insects hearts additionally contain ostial cells, also transversely striated muscle cells, but which do not participate in heart contraction.

def: "A endothelial cell of a lymphatic vessel. The border of the oak leaf-shaped endothelial cell of initial lymphatics are joined by specialized buttons. The discontinuous feature of buttons distinguishes them from zippers in collecting lymphatics, but both types of junctions are composed of proteins typical of adherens junctions and tight junctions found in the endothelium of blood vessels. Buttons seal the sides of flaps of the oak leaf-shaped endothelial cell, leaving open the tips of flaps as routes for fluid entry without disassembly and reformation of intercellular junctions."

def: "A cell of the cuboidal epithelium that covers the lens. The cells of the lens epithelium regulate most of the homeostatic functions of the lens. As ions, nutrients, and liquid enter the lens from the aqueous humor, Na+/K+ ATPase pumps in the lens epithelial cells pump ions out of the lens to maintain appropriate lens osmolarity and volume, with equatorially positioned lens epithelium cells contributing most to this current. The activity of the Na+/K+ ATPases keeps water and current flowing through the lens from the poles and exiting through the equatorial regions. The cells of the lens epithelium also serve as the progenitors for new lens fibers. It constantly lays down fibers in the embryo, fetus, infant, and adult, and continues to lay down fibers for lifelong growth."

comment: In a consensus model of unidirectional secretion, aqueous humour is formed by transferring solute, principally NaCl, from stroma to posterior chamber, with water passively following the osmotic gradient. Unidirectional secretion comprises three sequential steps. First, NaCl is transferred from the stromal interstitium into the pigmented ciliary epithelial (PE) cells. Second, solute passes from the PE into the non-pigmented ciliary epithelial (NPE) cells through gap junctions. Finally, NPE cells release Na+ and Cl− into the aqueous humour. {xref="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exer.2003.09.021"}

comment: This cell type can be purified from optic nerves and other regions of the embryonic, postnatal and adult rat CNS and can be differentiated in vitro to oligodendrocytes and type-2 astrocytes. Some references use the terms 'oligodendrocyte precursor cell' and 'oligodendrocyte type-2 astrocyte (O-2A) progenitor' to refer to the same entity (e.g., PMID:10704434), while others describe an oligodendrocyte type-2 astrocyte (O-2A) progenitor cell as the precurosr to oligodendrocyte- and type-2 astrocyte- progenitor cells (e.g, ISBN:9780702028991). {xref="PMID:10704434", xref="ISBN:9780702028991", xref="PMID:2182078"}

Unless there is a consensus among anatomists that cardiocytes refer only to muscle cells, we will treat them as a general class of cells in the heart.

comment: A myelinating Schwann cell wraps around a single axon. Myelination occurs in larger diameter axons, while a process called ensheathment occurs on smaller diameter axons in which a single cell wraps around multiple small, unmyelinated axons separating them with a thin layer of cytoplasm. The structure formed is called a Remak bundle. {xref="PMID:16807057"}

This cell type has thin long bipolar cytoplasmic processes, pinocytotic vesicles, fragments of external lamina and/or external lamina-like material, attachment plaques, and desmosome-like junctions. Perineurial cells historically have been referred to as fibroblasts because of shape; however, unlike fibroblasts, a perineurial cell: does not have a compact nucleus and large endoplasmic reticulum; does have a double basement membrane opposed to a single basal lamina; is carefully joined to other perineurial cells by tight junctions into a single sheet as opposed to arranged in a large mass; and finally, can surround a small axon bundle at a nerve terminal whereas a fibroblast cannot."

comment: Needs logical definition. Should be capable_of skeletal system morphogenesis? or skeletal tissue development? needs to be added to GO. NOTES:a cell type of the early embryo (see also: mesenchymal cells) that will give rise to mineralized connective tissue. Scleroblasts can differentiate into osteoblasts (bone-forming cells), chondroblasts (cartilage-forming cells), odontoblasts (dentin-forming cells), ameloblasts (enamel-forming cells). The mesenchymal cells developing into osteoblasts and chondroblasts are derived from the mesoderm. Those developing into odontoblasts are neural crest cells. Those developing into ameloblasts are derived from the ectoderm. (http://www.copewithcytokines.de/cope.cgi?key=scleroblasts)

Ultrastructurally, this cell type is characterized by the presence of cytoplasmic dense core granules, which are considered the storage sites of amine and peptide hormones. Lung neuroendocrine cells are innervated and appear as solitary cells or as clustered masses, localized at airway bifurcation sites, called neuroepithelial bodies that can release serotonin in response to hypoxia and interact with sensory nerve terminals. Lung neuroendocrine cells also function as reserve stem cells that repair the surrounding epithelium after injury." [doi:10.3109/01902148209069653, doi:10.7554/eLife.78216, PMID:33355253]

comment: It has been noted in at least some mammalian species that the urothelial basal cell type is distinguished by expression of high levels of cytokeratin-5 (CK5), p63 and the signalling molecule Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Similar to intermediate cells, the urothelial basal cell type expresses CK17 but is negative for uroplakins (UPK) and CK20. Urothelial basal cells have also been noted to be smaller in diameter than urothelial intermediate cells. {xref="doi:10.1038/s41385-022-00565-0"}
