Thus there is here no counterpart of ‘object’. In BFO 1.0 ‘process’ served as such a counterpart. In BFO 2.0 ‘process’ is, rather, the occurrent counterpart of ‘material entity’. Those natural – as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed – units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay.

property_value: IAO:0000112 "or with divisions drawn by cognitive subjects for practical reasons, such as the division of a cake (before slicing) into (what will become) slices (and thus member parts of an object aggregate). However, this does not mean that fiat object parts are dependent for their existence on divisions or delineations effected by cognitive subjects. If, for example, it is correct to conceive geological layers of the Earth as fiat object parts of the Earth, then even though these layers were first delineated in recent times, still existed long before such delineation and what holds of these layers (for example that the oldest layers are also the lowest layers) did not begin to hold because of our acts of delineation.Treatment of material entity in BFOExamples viewed by some as problematic cases for the trichotomy of fiat object part, object, and object aggregate include: a mussel on (and attached to) a rock, a slime mold, a pizza, a cloud, a galaxy, a railway train with engine and multiple carriages, a clonal stand of quaking aspen, a bacterial community (biofilm), a broken femur. Note that, as Aristotle already clearly recognized, such problematic cases – which lie at or near the penumbra of instances defined by the categories in question – need not invalidate these categories. The existence of grey objects does not prove that there are not objects which are black and objects which are white; the existence of mules does not prove that there are not objects which are donkeys and objects which are horses. It does, however, show that the examples in question need to be addressed carefully in order to show how they can be fitted into the proposed scheme, for example by recognizing additional subdivisions [29" xsd:string

It was first adopted by the 18th Session of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, (1989).\n\nThe Codex Classification includes food commodities and animal feedstuffs for which Codex maximum residue limits will not necessarily be established. The Classification is intended to be as complete a listing of food commodities in trade as possible, classified into groups on the basis of the commodity's similar potential for pesticide residues.\n\nThe Classification may also be appropriate for other purposes such as setting maximum levels for other types of residues or for other contaminants in food. The Codex Classification should be consulted in order to obtain a precise description of the food or animal feed commodities and, especially, in cases where Codex maximum residue limits have been set for groups of food and groups of animal feedstuffs. The Codex Classification is intended to promote harmonization of the terms used to describe commodities which are subject to maximum residue limits and of the approach to grouping commodities with similar potential for residue for which a common group maximum residue limit can be set."

def: "Tunicates, previously known as *Urochordata* or urochordates, are members of the *Tunicata*, a subphylum of the phylum *Chordata*. They are marine filter feeders with a saclike morphology. In their respiration and feeding they take in water through an incurrent (or inhalant) siphon and expel the filtered water through an excurrent (or exhalant) siphon. Most adult tunicates are sessile and attached to rocks or similarly suitable surfaces on the ocean floor; others such as salps, doliolids and pyrosomes swim in the pelagic zone as adults. Various species are commonly known as sea squirts or sea pork." []

comment: LanguaL curation note: A food product is characterized by its main ingredient (food source and part); the addition of secondary ingredients is considered a treatment applied to the product. Secondary ingredients are indexed according to rules that are based on the order of predominance by weight (not counting water) as seen from the label statement, formulation or recipe and/or from the amount of the ingredient as percentage of total product weight. The general rule is:  an ingredient is always indexed if it is the second ingredient in order of predominance, if it is used as a filling, or if it is part of the product name(e.g., raisin bread). Specific rules are given in the scope note for the individual ingredient added; these rules specify more exhaustive indexing. For example, *MUSHROOM ADDED* is indexed regardless of ingredient position. another specific rule is given in the scope note for *SALTED*:  Use if the level of salt is more than 4%. Such a rule is used only when the percentage level can be inferred from the list of ingredients.

def: "A collective phyllome structure (PO:0025023) composed all of the carpels (PO:0009030) in a flower (PO:0009046)." []
comment: If annotating gene expression to a gynoecium with a single carpel (PO:0009030), the annotation should go on carpel. A gynoecium with two or more carpels may be either syncarpous (carpels fused) or apopcarpous (carpels free) or the carpels may be partially fused. The word pistil is used synonymously with gynoecium for a synocarpous gynoecium, and synonymously with carpel for an apocarpous gynoecium, whether it has one or more carpels. In Zea mays, gynoecia of tassel florets and of the lower florets of ear spikelets usually do not develop fully, and they are present in a rudimentary state. If you are annotating to this structure for Zea mays or other grasses, please also add an annotation to the corresponding floret type. Choose the most specific term possible from: spikelet floret (PO:0009082), ear floret (PO:0006354), lower floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear (PO:0006353), lower floret of sessile spikelet of ear (PO:0006351), upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear (PO:0006350), upper floret of sessile spikelet of ear (PO:0006352), tassel floret (PO:0006310), lower floret of pedicellate spikelet of tassel (PO:0006313), lower floret of sessile spikelet of tassel (PO:0006315), upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of tassel (PO:0006314), upper floret of sessile spikelet of tassel (PO:0006316).

comment: This is a parent term to describe both collective organ part structure (PO:0025269)  (e.g. septum), as well as collective plant organ structure (PO:0025007) (which was formerly named collective plant structure), for example shoot system (PO:0009006).

comment: The shoot system (PO:0009006) develops fron the shoot apical meristem (PO:0020148) in the plant embryo (PO:0009009) in vascular plants.  In lower plants the gametophore (PO:0030018) arises from a gametophore meristematic apical cell (PO:0030019) in the protonema (PO:0030003).
