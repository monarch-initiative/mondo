It was first adopted by the 18th Session of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, (1989).\n\nThe Codex Classification includes food commodities and animal feedstuffs for which Codex maximum residue limits will not necessarily be established. The Classification is intended to be as complete a listing of food commodities in trade as possible, classified into groups on the basis of the commodity's similar potential for pesticide residues.\n\nThe Classification may also be appropriate for other purposes such as setting maximum levels for other types of residues or for other contaminants in food. The Codex Classification should be consulted in order to obtain a precise description of the food or animal feed commodities and, especially, in cases where Codex maximum residue limits have been set for groups of food and groups of animal feedstuffs. The Codex Classification is intended to promote harmonization of the terms used to describe commodities which are subject to maximum residue limits and of the approach to grouping commodities with similar potential for residue for which a common group maximum residue limit can be set."

def: "Tunicates, previously known as *Urochordata* or urochordates, are members of the *Tunicata*, a subphylum of the phylum *Chordata*. They are marine filter feeders with a saclike morphology. In their respiration and feeding they take in water through an incurrent (or inhalant) siphon and expel the filtered water through an excurrent (or exhalant) siphon. Most adult tunicates are sessile and attached to rocks or similarly suitable surfaces on the ocean floor; others such as salps, doliolids and pyrosomes swim in the pelagic zone as adults. Various species are commonly known as sea squirts or sea pork." []
