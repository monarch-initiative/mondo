def: "A type of bladder dysfunction caused by neurologic damage. Neurogenic bladder can be flaccid or spastic. Common manifestatios of neurogenic bladder are overflow incontinence, frequency, urgency, urge incontinence, and retention." [HPO:probinson, PMID:18095004, PMID:22400020]
comment: Neurogenic bladder sphincter dysfunction (NBSD) can develop as a result of a lesion at any level in the nervous system, including the cerebral cortex, spinal cord, or peripheral nervous system. Neurologic conditions in children leading to neurogenic bladder dysfunction are predominantly congenital neural tube defects (including myelomeningocele, lipomeningocele, sacral agenesis, and occult lesions causing tethered cord). Acquired causes such as spinal cord tumors or trauma or sequelae of transverse myelitis are less frequent. Whereas from an etiologic standpoint neurogenic bladder dysfunction is a heterogeneous group, medical management will be similar irrespective of the underlying cause.

comment: Cleft palate is a developmental defect that occurs between the 7th and 12th week of pregnancy. Normally, the palatine processes fuse during this time to form the soft and hard palate. A failure of fusion results in a cleft palate. The clinical spectrum ranges from bifid uvula, to (incomplete or complete) cleft of the soft palate, up to (complete or incomplete) cleft of both the soft and hard palate.

comment: Normal values for the height of the vermilion are available [Farkas, 1981], but measurements are not commonly used. Most clinicians determine this feature subjectively or use the Likert scale for Caucasians and African Americans [Astley and Clarren, 2000]. The height of the vermilion of the upper lip varies among ethnic groups, and the vermilion should be compared to a population of same ethnic background. The thinness of the upper lip vermilion is sensitive to facial expression. On profile view, a thin vermilion is less convex than usual. A thin upper lip vermilion may be associated with a smooth philtrum and an absence of the Cupid's bow, but these should be assessed separately.

comment: Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles, others by standard deviations. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean. Microcephaly is divided into primary microcephaly, which is present at birth, and secondary microcephaly, which develops postnatally. The crucial difference between these groupings is that primary microcephaly is usually a static developmental anomaly, whereas secondary microcephaly indicates a progressive neurodegenerative condition

comment: Macrocephaly can be due to hydrocephalus (increased CFSF), megalencephaly (increased brain volume) or thickening of the skull. Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far above the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Macrocephaly is an absolute term.

comment: Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.

comment: The feature that differentiates glaucoma from other causes of visual morbidity is a characteristic pattern of damage to the optic nerve head. This is most easily recognised at the superior and inferior poles of the optic disc. The vertical cup:disc ratio (VCDR) has proved to be a simple, relatively robust index of glaucomatous loss of the neuroretinal rim. As with intraocular pressure, VCDR is a continuous variable within the population.

Others define "exophthalmos" as protusion secondary to endocrine dysfunction and "proptosis" as any non-endocrine-mediated protusion (Source: Wikipedia). This finding should be distinguished frm underdevelopment of the supraorbital ridge or maxilla/zygoma. In proptosis, the globe is anteriorly protuberant to the overall plane of the face.

comment: Various scales have been developed to describe the extent of vision loss and define blindness. Total blindness is the complete lack of form and visual light perception and is clinically recorded as NLP (no light perception). Blindness is frequently used to describe severe visual impairment with residual vision. Those described as having only light perception have no more sight than the ability to tell light from dark and the general direction of a light source.

Optic atrophy is an end stage that arises from myriad causes of optic nerve damage anywhere along the path from the retina to the lateral geniculate.

comment: Most women have between 11 and 13 menstrual periods each year. Bleeding usually lasts around 5 days (range: 2 to 7 days). When menstruation first starts, it can take up to 2 years to establish a regular cycle. After puberty, most women's menstruation is regular. The length of time between each period is similar. The normal menstrual cycle length is 28 (+/- 7) days days with the menstruation lasting between 2 and 7 days. It can take up to 2 years from menarche to develop a mature hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Within 1 year, 75 percent of girls have a cycle between 21 and 45 days. By the fifth gynecological year, 90 percent of girls will have regular cycles.

def: "Hypotonia is an abnormally low muscle tone (the amount of tension or resistance to movement in a muscle). Even when relaxed, muscles have a continuous and passive partial contraction which provides some resistance to passive stretching. Hypotonia thus manifests as diminished resistance to passive stretching. Hypotonia is not the same as muscle weakness, although the two conditions can co-exist." [HPO:probinson, PMID:21418198]
comment: Hypotonia can be caused by abnormalities of the central nervous system, any element of the motor unit (including the lower motoneuron), or both. Hypotonia is not a specific diagnosis, but can be observed in hundreds of genetic and other diseases. The first distinction to make when assessing a child with hypotonia is whether decreased muscle tone is a result of an abnormality of the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral neuromuscular system, or a combined abnormality involving both. Clinical findings suggestive of an abnormality of the CNS may include hyperreflexia, cognitive developmental delay, and seizures. In contrast, physical findings pointing towards a neuromuscular origin may include weakness, lack of antigravity movements, muscle atrophy, fasciculations, and/or diminished reflexes, most often in the context of normal cognitive function. The HPO term does not distinguish between these etiologies. Additional HPO terms should be used as required to describe associated features.

comment: By prenatal ultrasound, cerebellar hypoplasia is diagnosed if the cerebellum measures more than two standard deviations below the mean. In adults, cerebellar hypoplasia is typically diagnosed by computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Cerebellar hypoplasia can be diagnosed if there is a small cerebellum with fissures of normal size compared with the folia (this is a distinguishing characteristic compared with cerebellar atrophy). Cerebellar hypoplasia (CH) refers to an underdevelopment of the cerebellum. This category of cerebellar malformation is distinct from Dandy Walker malformation in that it does not involve a concurrent enlargement of the posterior fossa, and almost all individuals exhibit cognitive and motor impairments.

comment: It is important clinical to distinguish between muscle weakness, fatigue, and asthenia. Fatigue describes the inability to continue performing a task after multiple repetitions; in contrast, a patient with primary weakness is unable to perform the first repetition of the task. Asthenia is a sense of weariness or exhaustion in the absence of muscle weakness. Conditions that result in intrinsic muscle weakness can be divided into several main categories: infectious, neurologic, endocrine, inflammatory, rheumatologic, genetic, metabolic, electrolyte-induced, or drug-induced.

comment: Myoclonus may be synchronous (several muscle contracting simultaneously), spreading (several muscles contracting in sequence), or asynchronous (several muscles contracting with varying and unpredictable relative timing). Myoclonus is characterized by sudden unidirectional movement due to muscle contraction (positive myoclonus) or due to sudden brief muscle relaxation (negative myoclonus). Electrophysiological tests are very helpful in determining whether myoclonus is cortical, subcortical or spinal.

def: "Steatosis is a term used to denote lipid accumulation within hepatocytes." [HPO:probinson, PMID:31603713]
comment: Although steatosis is the hallmark of the fatty liver disease, it is not a specific feature because it can be seen as part of other disease processes, such as drug injury, Wilson disease, or hepatitis C virus infection (especially genotype-3). Involvement of less than 5% of the hepatocytes by steatosis is considered clinically insignificant and within reference range. Based on the morphologic appearance and the size of the lipid droplets within the cytoplasm of the hepatocytes, steatosis is characterized as macrovesicular or microvesicular. Macrovesicular steatosis is characterized by large lipid droplets occupying the cytoplasm, displacing the nucleus to the periphery (large droplet macrovesicular steatosis) or multiple small lipid droplets of variable size occupying the cytoplasm with the nucleus maintaining its central location (small droplet macrovesicular steatosis). Microvesicular steatosis is characterized by innumerable tiny, relatively uniform lipid vacuoles that result in a bubbly appearance of the hepatocytes.

comment: The vestibular apparatus is the nonauditory portion of the inner ear that mediates the subjective sensation of motion and spatial orientation of the head, adjusts muscular activity and body position to maintain posture, and stabilizes in space the fixation point of the eyes when the head moves, in order to provide a stable image upon the retina. The functioning of the vestibular system is often checked clinically by means of the caloric test, in which the head is tilted backward by about 60 degrees and either warm or cold water is introduced into the external auditory meatus on one side. The immediate results are usually vertigo, nausea, nystagmus, and twisting of the head and body.

comment: Clubfoot is a complex, multifactorial deformity with genetic and intrauterine factors. One popular theory postulates that a clubfoot is a result of intrauterine maldevelopment of the talus that leads to adduction and plantarflexion of the foot. On radiographic projection a clubfoot can be noted as parallel axes of talus and calcaneus.

comment: Eosinophils stain with acidophilic dyes including eosin red. They have a bilobed nucleus, are weakly phagocytic, and are involved in the immune defense against worms. Eosinophils are released into the peripheral blood in a phenotypically mature state, and are capable of undergoing activation and recruitment into tissues in response to appropriate stimuli, most notably cytokines interleukin-5 and the eotaxins. Eosinophils spend only a brief time in the peripheral blood (half-life of about 18 hours) before they migrate to the thymus or gastrointestinal tract, where they reside under homeostatic conditions. In response to inflammatory stimuli, eosinophils develop from committed bone marrow progenitors, after which they exit, migrate into the blood and subsequently accumulate in peripheral tissues where survival is prolonged.

comment: Anemia is not a specific entity but can result from many underlying pathologic processes. The three main causes of anemia are blood loss, decreased or faulty red blood cell production, and increased destruction of red blood cells. Various classifications are in clinical use including a classification according to the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the erythrocytes: microcytic, macrocytic, or normocytic. Anemias can also be classified according to variations in cell size and shape, as reflected by the red-cell distribution width (RDW). Additionally, anemias can be classified into those of inadequate production and hemolytic anemias.

comment: When describing acid-base abnormalities, acidosis and alkalosis refer to physiological processes that lower or raise the pH, respectively, while acidemia and alkalemia simply describe the state of an abnormal blood pH. This distinction is important: a patient with acidemia could have both a respiratory and metabolic acidosis as well as a concurrent metabolic alkalosis.

def: "Metabolic acidosis (MA) is characterized by a fall in blood pH due to a reduction of serum bicarbonate concentration. This can occur as a result of either the accumulation of acids (high anion gap MA) or the loss of bicarbonate from the gastrointestinal tract or the kidney (hyperchloremic MA). By definition, MA is not due to a respirary cause." [HPO:probinson, PMID:17936961, PMID:31418093]
comment: The Henderson-Hasselbalch method defines metabolic acidosis by the presence of an acid-base imbalance associated with a plasma bicarbonate concentration below 20 mmol/L. The association of this imbalance with decreased pH is called acidemia, which is often described as severe when the pH is equal to or below 7.20. Arterial blood gas measurements can be performed in patients with a decreased plasma bicarbonate level so as to eliminate respiratory alkalosis, confirm the diagnosis of metabolic acidosis, and test for mixed acidosis.

def: "Body temperature elevated above the normal range." [HPO:sdoelken, PMID:9759682]
comment: Fever has been defined as a state of elevated core temperature, which is often, but not necessarily, part of the defensive responses of multicellular organisms (host) to the invasion of live (microorganisms) or inanimate matter recognized as pathogenic or alien by the host. The febrile response (of which fever is a component) is a complex physiologic reaction to disease, involving a cytokine-mediated rise in core temperature, generation of acute phase reactants, and activation of numerous physiologic, endocrinologic, and immunologic systems. The rise in temperature during fever is to be distinguished from that occurring during episodes of hyperthermia. Unlike fever, hyperthermia involves an unregulated rise in body temperature in which pyrogenic cytokines are not directly involved and against which standard antipyretics are ineffective. It represents a failure of thermoregulatory homeostasis, in which there is uncontrolled heat production, inadequate heat dissipation, or defective hypothalamic thermoregulation.

Vomiting has been defined as the forceful expulsion of the contents of the stomach, duodenum, or jejunum through the oral cavity. While nausea and vomiting are often thought to exist on a temporal continuum, this is not always the case.

comment: A tonic-clonic seizure may be generalised from onset or progress from a focal seizure to a bilateral tonic clonic seizure. This term describes the observed semiology of the seizure without specifying whether the onset is focal or generalized. Thus it can be used for coding bilateral tonic-clonic seizures when the onset is not known. This form of seizure was formerly commonly called grand mal seizure.

def: "A generalized non-motor (absence) seizure is a type of a type of dialeptic seizure that is of electrographically generalized onset. It is a generalized seizure characterised by an interruption of activities, a blank stare, and usually the person will be unresponsive when spoken to. Any ictal motor phenomena are minor in comparison to these non-motor features." [HPO:probinson, PMID:28276060, PMID:28276062, PMID:28276064]
comment: in 2017 the ILAE Commission for Classification and Terminology recommended classifying a seizure as having focal or generalized onset only when there is a high degree of confidence (over 80%, arbitrarily chosen to parallel the usual allowable beta error) in the accuracy of this determination; see Dialeptic seizure.

comment: The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei (striatum, pallidum substantia nigra, and the subthalamic nucleus) at the base of the forebrain that are connected to the cerebral cortex, the thalamus, and other areas. The basal ganglia subserve motor functions that are distinct from those of the pyramidal (corticospinal) tract, for which reason neurologic abnormalities caused by lesions to the basal ganglia are often referred to as extrapyramidal.

comment: Homocystine is a disulfide derivate of homocysteine (a precursor of cysteine). Patients with homocystinuria have a clinical phenotype similar to that of patients affected by Marfan syndrome (pectus excavatum, dislocated lenses, etc). This term does not describe the disease entity, but rather the finding of an increased concentration of homocystine in urine, which can be easily detected by a sensitive test for disulphide compounds (the cyanide-nitroprusside reaction) and using chromatographic techniques. Homocystinuria can be caused by biochemical defects including cystathionine B-synthase deficiency, N5-methyltetrahydrofolate:homocystine methyltransferase deficiency, N5,10-methylentetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency, and methhylcobalamin deficiency.

comment: Headache is one of the most common types of recurrent pain as well as one of the most frequent symptoms in neurology. In addition to occasional headaches, there are well-defined headache disorders that vary in incidence, prevalence and duration and can be divided into two broad categories. In secondary headache disorders, headaches are attributed to another condition, such as brain tumour or head injury; for the primary disorders the headache is not due to another condition.

comment: Patients often describe myotonia as stiffness that is worse at the onset of activity and that improves with repeated muscle contractions. Myotonia tends to worsen in cold weather. Myotonia can be elicited by voluntary muscle contraction of by muscle percussion (e.g., by tapping the thenar eminence). During physical examination, myotonia may be elicited by asking the patient to make a tight fist and then quickly open the hand. Myotonia is caused by an abnormality in the muscle membrane, i.e., of the ion channels that control the contraction of muscle fibers.

comment: The word skeletal dysplasia is most often used to describe a group of over 380 inherited conditions that involve abnormal development of bones and connective tissues. However, the word can also be used to describe the presence of congenital defects of bones or connective tissues that are found in one or more of the diseases, especially on prenatal ultrasound, i.e., a situation in which it is often not yet possible to make an exact etiological diagnosis. This is the sense of the phrase we use in the HPO. It is, however, preferable to annotate the observed abnormalities.

There are several issues involved in hypophosphatemic rickets such as calcium, vitamin D, phosphorus deficiencies. Moreover, other disorder can be associated with its occurrence such as absorption defects due to pancreatic, intestinal, gastric, and renal disorders and hepatobiliary disease. Symptoms are usually seen in childhood and can be varied in severity. Severe forms may be linked to bowing of the legs, poor bone growth, and short stature as well as joint and bone pain. Hypophosphatemic rickets are associated with renal excretion of phosphate, hypophosphatemia, and mineral defects in bones. The familial type of the disease is the most common type of rickets."

comment: B cells are bursal or bone marrow-derived lymphocytes whose principle function in the adaptive immune system is to make antibodies against antigens. A simple definition of B lymphocytes is a population of cells that express clonally diverse cell surface immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors recognizing specific antigenic epitopes. Over 10 B cell-specific cell surface molecules have been identified by monoclonal antibodies, including CD19, which is considered a pan-B cell and possibly follicular dendritic cell marker, and CD20, which is considered to be a marker for mature B cells.

comment: This type of weakness is pathognomonic for an abnormality of the neuromuscular junction such as myasthenia gravis. A characteristic form of muscular weakness that worsens after use of affected muscles. Myasthenia is caused by failure of neuromuscular transmission, which results from the binding of autoantibodies to proteins involved in signaling at the neuromuscular junction, including especially the nicotinic acetyl choline receptor (AChR) or, less frequently, a muscle-specific tyrosine kinase involved in AChR clustering.

Congenital abnormalities are often but not always hereditary in nature. Whether a disease manifestation is diagnosed to be intrauterine or congenital may depend on the time at which diagnostic procedures are performed. Thus, most congenital abnormalities are also intrauterine. This term should be used for phenotypic abnormalities or diseases initially observed at the time of birth. For abnormalities observed prior to (e.g., by fetal ultrasound), use the term Antenatal onset (HP:0030674).

def: "Any abnormality of the skeletal muscle cell. Muscle fibers are subdivided into two types. Type I fibers are fatigue-resistant and rich in oxidative enzymes (they stain light with the myosin ATPase reaction), and type II fibers are fast-contracting, fatigue-prone, and rich in glycolytic enzymes (these fibers stain darkly). Normal muscle tissue has a random distribution of type I and type II fibers." [HPO:probinson, PMID:22938878]
comment: Normal human muscle is composed of many individual muscle fibers bundled together by layers of connective tissue that are arranged in a nesting-doll like fashion. The inner most structure, the single muscle fiber, is covered by a thin layer of primarily reticular fibers called the endomysium. The endomysium is quite inconspicuous and muscle fibers appear to be in direct contact with each other. The finest capillaries, nerve twigs and lymphatic capillaries are found within the endomysium. Groups of muscle fibers are bound together by the thicker perimysium, forming structures called fascicles. Capillaries, nerve fibers and lymphatic vessels also track in the perimyseum. Bundles of fascicles are encased within the dense irregular connective tissue of the epimysium. These connective tissue layers provide mechanical protection for the muscle fibers and increase the tensile strength of the muscle. The layers are continuous with the tendon, which provides attachment to bone. Individual muscle fibers are syncytia, formed by embryonic fusion of many myoblasts or later, myosatellite cells. Each muscle fiber contains many nuclei, peripherally positioned immediately adjacent to the sarcolemmal membrane. In healthy muscle only 3-5 percent of fibers contain nuclei that are located internally, within the cell, but many disease processes lead to internal nuclei. Each nucleus provides a segment of the cell with needed translated protein products.

comment: A bulla is a large vesicle described as a rounded or irregularly shaped blister containing serous or seropurulent fluid, equal to or greater than 10mm. In approaching blistering diseases, there are 3 fundamental criteria to consider: (1) the site or level of the blister (or the lowest level of vesiculation): subcorneal, midepidermis, suprabasal, subepidermal; (2) the findings that implicate the mechanism of blister formation (spongiosis, acantholysis, blistering degeneration, or epidermolysis); and (3) the type of inflammation (neutrophilic, lymphocytic, eosinophilic, mixed), if present.

def: "A heterogeneous group of congenital spinal anomalies that result from defective closure of the neural tube early in fetal life." [HPO:probinson]
comment: Spinal dysraphism, or neural tube defect comprises a heterogeneous group of congenital spinal anomalies that result from defective closure of the neural tube early in fetal life and anomalous development of the caudal cell mass. The anatomic features common to the entire group is an anomaly in the midline structures of the back, especially the absence of some of the neural arches, and defects of the skin, filum terminale, nerves, and spinal cord. Open forms of spinal dysraphism include myelocele, meningocele, and myelomeningocele. These open forms are often associated with hydrocephalus and Arnold-Chiari malformation type II and may be classified as spina bifida aperta. Closed forms of spinal dysraphism includ spina bifida occulta.

def: "Stridor is a high pitched sound resulting from turbulent air flow in the upper airway." [HPO:probinson, PMID:26229557]
comment: Stridor is different from wheezing by the following reasons. It is louder over the neck than chest wall. Secondly; stridor is mainly inspiratory. If occurs in expiration, it is usually biphasic. On the other hand; wheeze is mainly expiratory and occurs during both phases. It indicates extrathoracic upper-airway obstruction (supraglottic lesions like laryngomalacia, vocal cord lesion) when heard on inspiration. It occurs in expiration if associated with intrathoracic tracheobronchial lesions (tracheomalacia, bronchomalacia, and extrinsic compression). It occurs in both phases if lesion is fixed, for example, stenosis. Stridor is caused by the turbulent flow passing through a narrowed segment of the upper respiratory tract.

comment: Ebstein's anomaly is often associated with a hypoplastic right ventricle, patent foramen ovale, and a degree of cyanosis dependent on the amount if inadequacy of the tricuspid valve. Ebstein's anomaly may be associated with Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome or other arrythmias.

There are five major types of lipoproteins: (i) chylomicrons; VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein); (iii) IDL (intermediate-density lipoprotein); (iv) LDL (low-density lipoprotein); and (v) HDL (high-density lipoprotein). Clinical measures assess the amount of cholesterol carried by different lipoproteins. For instance, LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) is the maount of cholesterol carried by LDL.

comment: The main ictal manifestation of dialeptic seizures is an alteration of consciousness rather than motor or sensory features. The term describes the pure clinical semiology of a seizure and is used independently of the ictal electrographic findings: it could describe a seizure of focal, generalized or unknown onset. In 2017 the ILAE Commission for Classification and Terminology recommended classifying a seizure as having focal or generalized onset only when there is a high degree of confidence (>80%, arbitrarily chosen to parallel the usual allowable beta error) in the accuracy of this determination.

Usually the patient will be unresponsive when spoken to. Duration is a few seconds to half a minute with very rapid recovery. Although not always available, an EEG would usually show 3 Hz generalized epileptiform discharges during the event." [HPO:jalbers, PMID:28276060, PMID:28276062, PMID:28276064, PMID:6790275]
comment: In 2017 the ILAE Commission for Classification and Terminology recommended classifying a seizure as having focal or generalized onset only when there is a high degree of confidence (>80%, arbitrarily chosen to parallel the usual allowable beta error) in the accuracy of this determination; see Dialeptic seizure. Typical absences have 2 essential components: (1) clinically the impairment of consciousness (absence), and (2) EEG generalized 3 Hz to 4 Hz (less than 2.5 Hz) spike and slow wave discharges.

In endochondral ossification, the mesenchyme differentiates into a cartilaginous intermediate, which serves as a template (anlange) that is subsequently removed and replaced by bone. Most bones are formed via endochondral ossification, including those at the base of the skull, the vertebral column, pectoral and pelvic regions and long bones of the extremities. A reduction in the amount of mineralized bone compared with that expected for a given developmental age. In clinicakl parlance, reduced ossification and delayed ossification are often used synonymously, but in principle a bone delayed ossification in a child can display normal ossification at a later developmental stage. The HPO will therefore treat poor, reduced, and decreased officiation as synonymous, and delayed ossification as a specific kind of reduced ossification.

Chronic pain, in contrast, may be considered a disease state. It is pain that outlasts the normal time of healing.

namespace: human_phenotype
def: "A sudden, audible expulsion of air from the lungs through a partially closed glottis, preceded by inhalation." [HPO:probinson, PMID:16428719, PMID:17540788]
comment: The European Respiratory Society Task Force recommended two possible definitions of cough: (1) A three-phase expulsive motor act characterized by an inspiratory effort (inspiratory phase) followed by a forced expiratory effort against a closed glottis (compressive phase) and then by opening of the glottis and rapid expiratory airflow (expulsive phase);and (2) A forced expiratory manoeuvre, usually against a closed glottis and associated with a characteristic sound. The term Cough or any of its more specific descendents can be modified by the terms Acute (HP:0011009), Subacute (HP:0011011), and Chronic (HP:0011010). In adults, an acute cough lasts less than 3 weeks, a subacute cough from 3 to 8 weeks, and a chronic cough longer than 8 weeks. In children aged less than 15 years a chronic cough is defined as a daily cough lasting for over 4 weeks.

comment: Note that some of the terms, such as Intellectual disability, have children terms such as Severe intellectual disability that represent precomposed combinations of modifiers and phenotypic abnormality terms. This done where the medical community commonly uses these terms with a fixed meaning (for instance, the Intellectual disability terms are used with specific IQ ranges). For computational reasoning, the semantics are intended to be the same as if there was a combination of the phenotype term and the clinical modifier term.

comment: A paraprotein is a monoclonal immunoglobulin or light chain present in the blood or urine; it is produced by a clonal population of mature B cells, most commonly plasma cells. Plasma cell disorders can be considered as a spectrum of conditions ranging from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), through asymptomatic, to symptomatic myeloma. The frequency of paraprotein-associated heavy chains is IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD (in that order). Light chains may be kappa or lambda. Paraproteins are associated with both malignant and nonmalignant conditions and may lead to complications including neuropathy and nephropathy.

comment: The majority of viral infections acquired by nonimmunosuppressed individuals are asymptomatic or result in mild clinical manifestations. These individuals are able to mount effective immune responses that either clear the virus from the body or, for viruses that establish latency, maintain the virus in a dormant state. For individuals who are immunocompromised, because of a genetic immunodeficiency or immunosuppressive drug therapy, viral infections may result in life-threatening disease. Such patients present with infections that are severe, persistent, recurrent, or refractory to therapy and are usually caused by viruses of low virulence prevalent in the community.

def: "An abnormally reduced head circumference in a growing child. Head circumference is measured with a nonelastic tape and comprises the distance from above the eyebrows and ears and around the back of the head.

Microcephaly is defined as a head circumference (HC) that is great than two standard deviations below the mean of age- and gender-matched population based samples. Severe microcephaly is defined with an HC that is three standard deviations below the mean." [PMID:26505062]
comment: Although HC measures skull size, it typically also reflects overall brain volume and has been described as a widely used proxy of neural growth and brain size. Brain size outside of normal values is an important risk factor for cognitive and motor delay. Microcephaly at birth has been termed primary microcephaly and that acquired after birth is secondary microcephaly.

def: "Repeated, individually recognizable, intermittent movements or movement fragments that are almost always briefly suppresable and are usually associated with awareness of an urge to perform the movement." [HPO:sdoelken, PMID:20589866]
comment: Tics can be invisible to the observer, such as abdominal tensing or toe crunching. Common motor and phonic tics are, respectively, eye blinking and throat clearing. Movements of other movement disorders (for example, chorea, dystonia, myoclonus) must be distinguished from tics. Other conditions, such as autism and stereotypic movement disorder, also include movements which may be confused with tics. Tics must also be distinguished from the compulsions of OCD and from seizure activity. Tics may increase as a result of stress, fatigue, boredom, or high-energy emotions, which can include negative emotions, such as anxiety, but positive emotions as well, such as excitement or anticipation. Relaxation may result in a tic increase (for instance, watching television or using a computer), while concentration on an absorbing activity often leads to a decrease in tics.

def: "A contraction of the diaphragm that repeats several times per minute. In humans, the abrupt rush of air into the lungs causes the epiglottis to close, creating a hic sound. Also known as synchronous diaphragmatic flutter (SDF), or singultus, from the Latin singult, the act of catching one's breath while sobbing. The hiccup is an involuntary action involving a reflex arc." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: A bout of hiccups, in general, resolves itself without intervention, although many home remedies claim to shorten the duration, and medical treatment is occasionally necessary in cases of chronic hiccups. Hiccups are caused by many central and peripheral nervous system disorders, all from injury or irritation to the phrenic and vagus nerves, as well as toxic or metabolic disorders affecting the aforementioned systems. Hiccups often occur after consuming carbonated beverages, alcohol, dry breads, or spicy foods. Prolonged laughter or eating too fast are also known to cause hiccups. Persistent or intractable hiccups may be caused by any condition which irritates or damages the relevant nerves.

Tendons and muscles work together and can only exert a pulling force.

comment: The renal pyramids of the adult kidney resemble a cone with a broad base adjacent to the renal cortex and the narrow apex that is termed papilla. The adult renal medulla is made up of 10-18 pyramids. A pyramid consists of the medullary collecting ducts, loops of Henle, vasa recta (straight capillaries) and the interstitium. The main function of the medulla is to regulate concentration of the urine. The urine flows from the collecting ducts into the renal calyces and pelvis.

comment: Hyperesthesia is a common symptom of neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system. The neuropathic pain phenotype contains a spectrum of symptoms that can be roughly categorized into positive and negative symptoms. Hyperesthesia is a positive symptom of neuropathic pain. Positive symptoms are categorized as stimulus-dependent pain, stimulus-independent pain, and paresthesias.
