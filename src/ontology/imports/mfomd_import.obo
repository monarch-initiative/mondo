Thus there is here no counterpart of ‘object’. In BFO 1.0 ‘process’ served as such a counterpart. In BFO 2.0 ‘process’ is, rather, the occurrent counterpart of ‘material entity’. Those natural – as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed – units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay. Clear examples of boundaries of processes are almost always of the fiat sort (midnight, a time of death as declared in an operating theater or on a death certificate, the initiation of a state of war)" xsd:string

def: "A disease which is a disposition to undergo pathological mental processes." []
comment: The Mental Disease ontology follows the strategy of the Ontology of General Medical Science in distinguishing mental disease, mental disorder, diagnosis of mental disease, mental disease course and pathological mental process as separately distinguishable entities. Here is a quick guide to how these terms are used in this ontology. \n\nA mental disease is an underlying disposition to pathological mental processes. \n\nA mental disease course is the sum of the pathological mental processes that are caused by the underlying disease. \n\nA pathological mental process is a pathological process caused by a mental disease. \n\nA mental disorder is a physical disorder, for example, dysfunctional neurotransmitter receptors, altered brain connectivity, missing or damaged brain parts etc.  The disorder is the material basis for the disease and it is by virtue of the disorder that the disease causes the pathological processes that form part of the disease course. \n\nA diagnosis of a mental disease is a clinician's statement that a patient has a mental disease by virtue of observable manifestations of that disease, such as behaviour, observable aspects of the underlying disorder, or self-reported experiences. \n\n\n\n\n

comment: While the ontology subscribes to the widely accepted theory that there is a biomedical basis for mental diseases, the standard descriptions of mental disorders focus solely on symptomatic descriptions. Therefore, we have classified the mental disorders beneath OGMS's 'disease course' via a parent class 'mental disease course' rather than classifying them as diseases.

name: depressed mood episode
def: "A depressed mood episode is a pathological mental process characterised by persistent feelings of sadness, anxiety, guilt, anger, isolation or hopelessness and other negative valence emotions, disturbances in sleep and appetite, fatigue, loss of interest in usually enjoyable activities and morbid or suicidal ideation." []
comment: The criteria below are based on the formal DSM-IV criteria for a Major Depressive Episode. A diagnoses of major depressive episode requires that the patient has—over a two-week period—experienced five or more of the symptoms below, and these must be outside the patient's normal behaviour. Either depressed mood or decreased interest or pleasure must be one of the five (although both are frequently concomitant).\n\nMood\n    For the better part of nearly every day, the patient reports a depressed mood or appears depressed to others.\n        The patient may state that he or she has been feeling sad, depressed, blue, empty, "down in the dumps," hopeless, etc. If the patient is in denial about these feelings, yet appears to be on the verge of tearfulness, manifests a depressed facial expression and disposition, or appears to be overly irritable, these may also indicate the presence of depressed mood. Some people may report physical complaints (i.e., aches, pains, headaches) rather than depressed mood, and physical symptoms without physical cause are sometimes indicators of depression.\n\nAnhedonia and loss of interest\n\n    For most of nearly every day, interest or pleasure is markedly decreased in nearly all activities (noted by the patient or by others).\n        People suffering with depression tend to lose interest in things they once found enjoyable. Activities are no longer enjoyable and there is often a loss of interest in or desire for sex. People who are depressed may say, "I just don't care anymore," or "nothing matters anymore." Friends and family of the depressed person may notice that he/she has withdrawn from friends, or has neglected or quit doing activities that were once a source of enjoyment.\n\nChange in eating, appetite, or weight\n\n    Although not dieting, there is a marked loss or gain of weight (such as 5% in one month) or appetite is markedly decreased or increased nearly every day.\n    Changes in appetite take on two manifestations: under- or over-eating.\n        In the first instance, some people never feel hungry, can go long periods without wanting to eat, may forget to eat, or if they do eat a small amount of food may be sufficient. A reduction in weight is often associated with a melancholic type of depression.\n        In the second instance, some people tend toward an increase in appetite and may gain significant amounts of weight. They may tend to crave certain types of food such as sweets or carbohydrates. People with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) often crave foods high in carbohydrates. Weight gain is often associated with atypical depression.\n\nSleep\n\n    Nearly every day the patient sleeps excessively, known as hypersomnia, or not enough, known as insomnia.\n        Insomnia is the most common type of sleep disturbance for people who are clinically depressed. Having difficulty falling asleep at night is known as "initial" insomnia; waking in the middle of the night and being unable to go back to sleep as "middle insomnia", and; waking too early as "terminal insomnia". Insomnia is often associated with a melancholic type of depression.\n        A less frequent sleeping problem is oversleeping (called "hypersomnia"). This may occur in the form of sleeping for prolonged periods at night or increased sleeping during the daytime. Even with excess sleep, a person may still feel tired and sluggish during the day. People with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) may sleep longer during the winter months. Hypersomnia is often associated with an atypical depression.\n\nMotor activity\n\n    Nearly every day others can see that the patient's activity is agitated or slow.\n        People suffering from depression may be either quite agitated (psychomotor agitation), or very lethargic (psychomotor retardation) in their mannerisms and behavior. If a person is agitated, he or she may find it difficult to sit still, may pace the room, wring his/her hands, or fidget with clothes or objects. Someone with psychomotor retardation tends to move sluggishly, may move across a room very slowly, avert his/her eyes, sit slumped in a chair and speak slowly, saying little.\n        In terms of diagnosis, the agitation or slowing down of one's demeanor must be to the degree that it can be observed by others.\n\nFatigue\n\n    Nearly every day the person experiences extreme fatigue.[3]\n        A decrease in energy and feeling fatigued are very common symptoms for those who are clinically depressed. A person may feel tired without having engaged in any physical activity, and day-to-day tasks become difficult, including getting washed and dressed in the morning. Job tasks or housework become very tiring, and the person finds that his/her work at home, school, or on the job suffers.[4]\n\nSelf-worth\n\n    Nearly every day the patient feels worthless or inappropriately guilty. These feelings are not just about being depressed, they may be delusional.\n        Depressed people may think of themselves in very negative, unrealistic ways such as manifesting a preoccupation with past "failures", personalisation of trivial events, or believing that minor mistakes prove their inadequacy. They also may have an unrealistic sense of personal responsibility and see things beyond their control as being their fault. Additionally, self-loathing is common in clinical depression, and can lead to a downward spiral when combined with other symptoms.\n\nConcentration\n\n    Noted by the patient or by others, nearly every day the patient is indecisive or has trouble thinking or concentrating.\n        A person with depression frequently experiences negative and pessimistic thoughts, and reports that his/her ability to think, concentrate, or make decisions becomes impaired. Memory and distraction problems are common. This problem can be notably pronounced, causing significant difficulty in functioning for those involved in intellectually demanding activities.\n\nThoughts of death\n\n    The patient has had repeated thoughts about death (other than the fear of dying), suicide (with or without a plan) or has made a suicide attempt.\n        The frequency and intensity of thoughts about suicide can range from believing that friends and family would be better off if one were dead, to frequent thoughts about committing suicide (generally related to wishing to stop the emotional pain), to detailed plans about how the suicide would be carried out. Less severely suicidal people may have regular thoughts of suicide, while those who are more severely suicidal may have made specific plans and decided upon a day and location for the suicide attempt.\n            Thoughts of suicide occur mostly when triggered. Thoughts of suicide happen more frequently than normal.\n\nDiagnostic caveats\n\nIn diagnosing the symptoms a trained therapist must take the following into account:\n\n    These symptoms must cause clinically important distress, or impair work, social or personal functioning, and they should not fulfil the criteria for Mixed Episode.\n    The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., abuse of a drug or medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., hypothyroidism).\n    Other than in the case of severe symptoms (severely impaired functioning, severe preoccupation with worthlessness, ideas of suicide, delusions or hallucinations or psychomotor retardation), the episode should not have begun within two months of the loss of a loved one.\n \n\n[Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_episode]\n
