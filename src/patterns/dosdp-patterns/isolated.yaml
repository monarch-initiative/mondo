description: 'Some diseases exist in both isolated and syndromic forms. For example,
  aniridia ([MONDO_0019172 aniridia](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0019172),
  [MONDO_0020148''syndromic aniridia''](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0020148)
  and [MONDO_0007119 ''isolated aniridia''](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0007119).
  Use this pattern to define the isolated form of a disease when a term exists for
  the isolated/syndromic-neutral version. In general, this pattern should be used
  in parallel with syndromic. E.g. if you make a term ''syndromic disease, you should
  also have ''isolated disease'' [see pattern here(https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/blob/master/src/patterns/dosdp-patterns/syndromic.yaml).  Note
  that the isolated and syndromic forms will be inferred to be disjoint due to the
  GCI pattern.

  Examples: [''isolated aniridia''](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0007119),
  [''isolated dystonia''](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0015494), [''isolated
  focal palmoplantar keratoderma''](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0017673)'
