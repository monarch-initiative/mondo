description: 'A design pattern for conditions such as post-herpetic neuralgia or postinfectious
  encephalitis, where the disease is secondary to the initial infection.

  TODO: write better guidelines on what constitutes a secondary disease vs primary.
  * We do not use this pattern for AIDS-HIV for example, instead representing this
  is using SubClassOf. * We draw a distinction between infectious and postinfectious
  encepahlitis. * we do not use this pattern for chickenpox, but we do for shingles '
