description: 'This pattern is for grouping classes to group terms that are disease or disease-like. 
Sometimes we feel there is insufficient reason to group, and X and X-like are not connected via shared 
is-a but instead by shares-features-with. Children of this grouping class should be X and X-like disease.
  Examples: [viral disease or post-viral disorder](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0100321)'
