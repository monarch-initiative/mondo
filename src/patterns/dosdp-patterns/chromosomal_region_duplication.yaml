description: 'This pattern is meant to be used for chromosomal disorder which consists in the duplication of chromosomal region in which the chromosomal region is known. "Duplication" means an increase of copy number, and includes an extra copy (partial trisomy) and 2 extra copies (partial tetrasomy, also called triplication) of chromosomal region. Note that this pattern does not include the duplication of the entire chromosome (trisomy, tetrasomy, pentasomy).'
