description: "This pattern is used for inborn errors of metabolism that cause disruption\
  \ of a specific biological process, such as enzyme activity or ion transport. \n\
  Examples: ['5-oxoprolinase deficiency (disease)'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0009825),\
  \ [inborn disorder of methionine cycle and sulfur amino acid metabolism](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0019222),\
  \ [inborn aminoacylase deficiency](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0017686)\
