pattern_iri: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo/patterns/inborn_metabolic_disrupts.yaml

description: >-
    This pattern is used for inborn errors of metabolism that cause disruption of a specific biological process, such as enzyme activity or ion transport. 

    Examples: ['5-oxoprolinase deficiency (disease)'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0009825),
    [inborn disorder of methionine cycle and sulfur amino acid metabolism](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0019222),
    [inborn aminoacylase deficiency](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0017686)
