description: 'This pattern is meant to be used for chromosomal disorder which consists of the deletion of part of a chromosome in which only the chromosome which part is deleted is known (the chromosomal region is not known). Note that when the chromosomal region is known, the chromosomal_region_deletion pattern should be used. Also note that this pattern does not include the loss of the entire chromosome (monosomy).'
