description: "Some diseases exist in both isolated and syndromic forms. For example,\
  \ aniridia ([MONDO_0019172 aniridia](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0019172),\
  \ [MONDO_0020148'syndromic aniridia'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0020148)\
  \ and [MONDO_0007119 'isolated aniridia'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0007119).\
  \ Use this pattern to define the syndromic form of a disease when a term exists\
  \ for the isolated/syndromic-neutral version. In general, this pattern should be\
  \ used in parallel with isolated. E.g. if you make a term 'syndromic disease, you\
  \ should also have 'isolated disease' [see pattern here(https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/blob/master/src/patterns/dosdp-patterns/isolated.yaml).\
  \ \nNote that the isolated and syndromic forms will be inferred to be disjoint due\
  \ to the GCI pattern."
