pattern_name: disease_series_by_groupofgenes

pattern_iri: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo/patterns/disease_series_by_groupofgenes.yaml

description: 'This pattern is for diseases that are caused by variation(s) in one of multiple genes, most often one gene belonging to a complex. For example: [non-severe combined immunodeficiency due to polymerase delta deficiency](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0800145)'. This pattern is shown for diseases where one of 2 (only) genes would be causal, but it is possible that more than 2 genes need to be included.
# this pattern does not allow for disease term in which the cause of the disease is a variation in multiple genes at the same time.
