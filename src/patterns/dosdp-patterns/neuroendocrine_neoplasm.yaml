pattern_name: neoendocrine_neoplasm

description: >4-

    Note that tumor is typically a synonym for neoplasm, although this
    can be context dependent. For NETs, NCIT uses the nomenclature 'tumor'
    to indicate 'well differentiated, low or intermediate grade tumor'.
    This can also be called carcinoid, see
    https://www.cancer.org/cancer/gastrointestinal-carcinoid-tumor/about/what-is-gastrointestinal-carcinoid.html
    We attempt to spell this out in our labels.
