description: 'This pattern should be used to refer to predisposition to cancer where the predisposition is inherited and the causal gene is known. The predisposed cancer/tumor is often variable dependent of the gene variations themselves. Therefore they are not always included in the definition and/or logical axioms. Examples: [BRCA1-related cancer predisposition](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0100096), [TP53-related cancer predisposition](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0100097)'
