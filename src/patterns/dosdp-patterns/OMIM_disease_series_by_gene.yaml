description: '

  This pattern is meant to be used for (1) OMIM Mendelian diseases (ie unitary genetic diseases, as described in
  [PMID:33417889](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7820621/)), including children of OMIM phenotypic
  series (OMIMPS), which are represented as grouping classes in Mondo, and (2) OMIA Mendelian diseases (https://omia.org/) which are defined by a variation in a gene.
  Notes about the OMIMPS (see also OMIM_phenotypic_series.yaml):  - every instance of the OMIMPS
  metaclass should be equivalent to (via annotated xref) to something in OMIMPS namespace
  - the OMIMPS will never have an asserted causative gene as logical axiom (and no
  single causative gene in text def) - the OMIMPS must never be equivalent to an OMIM:nnnnnn
  (often redundant with the above rule) - the OMIMPS must have an acronym synonym,
  e.g. HPE - the OMIMPS must have two or more subclasses (direct or indirect) that
  are equivalent to OMIMs and conform to this pattern - the subclasses should (not
  must) have a logical def that uses the PS as a genus  - the OMIM subclasses must
  have acronym synonyms that are the parent syn + number, e.g. HPE1, HPE2 - the primary
  label for the children should also be parent + {"type"} + number - the first member
  will usually have the same number local ID as the PS Examples: [holoprosencephaly
  1](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0009349), [3M syndrome 1](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0010117)'
