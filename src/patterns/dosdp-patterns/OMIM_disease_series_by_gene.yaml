description: '

  This pattern is meant to be used for OMIM diseases, including children of OMIM phenotypic
  series (OMIMPS), which are represented as grouping classes in Mondo. Notes about
  the OMIMPS (see also OMIM_phenotypic_series.yaml):  - every instance of the OMIMPS
  metaclass should be equivalent to (via annotated xref) to something in OMIMPS namespace
  - the OMIMPS will never have an asserted causative gene as logical axiom (and no
  single causative gene in text def) - the OMIMPS must never be equivalent to an OMIM:nnnnnn
  (often redundant with the above rule) - the OMIMPS must have an acronym synonym,
  e.g. HPE - the OMIMPS must have two or more subclasses (direct or indirect) that
  are equivalent to OMIMs and conform to this pattern - the subclasses should (not
  must) have a logical def that uses the PS as a genus  - the OMIM subclasses must
  have acronym synonyms that are the parent syn + number, e.g. HPE1, HPE2 - the primary
  label for the children should also be parent + {"type"} + number - the first member
  will usually have the same number local ID as the PS Examples: [holoprosencephaly
  1](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0009349), [3M syndrome 1](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0010117)'
