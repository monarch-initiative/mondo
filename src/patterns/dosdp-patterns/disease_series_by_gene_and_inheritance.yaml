description: "This pattern is for diseases that are caused by a single mutation in\
  \ a single gene, that have gene-based names, and are inherited by a specific mechanism,\
  \ succh as autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive. \nExamples: [Growth hormone\
  \ insensitivity syndrome with immune dysregulation](https://omim.org/phenotypicSeries/PS245590),\
  \ Growth hormone insensitivity with immune dysregulation 1, autosomal recessive\
  \ and Growth hormone insensitivity with immune dysregulation 2, autosomal dominant"
