description: 'This pattern is for diseases that are caused by a single mutation in
  a single gene, that have gene-based names, such as new disease terms that are requested
  by ClinGen, like MED12-related intellectual disability syndrome.  Examples: [MED12-related
  intellectual disability syndrome](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0100000),
  [TTN-related myopathy](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0100175), [MYPN-related
  myopathy](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0015023)'
