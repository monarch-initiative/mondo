description: This pattern should be used for terms in which a gene dysfunction causes
  a predisposition or susceptibility towards developing a specific disease. This pattern
  is a sub-pattern of [inherited_susceptibility.yaml](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/blob/master/src/patterns/dosdp-patterns/inherited_susceptibility.yaml)
