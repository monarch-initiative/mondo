description: >-

  Carcinomas are malignant neoplasms arising from epithelial cells.
  
  This is a Design pattern for classes representing carcinomas based
  on their location. This may be the site of origin, but it can also
  represent a secondary site for metastatized cancer.

  We use the generic 'disease has location' relation, which
  generalized over primary and secondary sites.
