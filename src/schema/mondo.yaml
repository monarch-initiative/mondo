      excludePresenceOfEnvironmentalMaterials:
        title: presence of environmental materials
        description: This code is for the presence of environmental materials, such as foreign body fragments or objects in the body and does not refer to a disease.

      excludeGeneticCarrier:
        title: genetic carrier
        description: The concept described is not a disease, it is for individual who is heterozygous for a recessive gene and thus does not express the recessive phenotype but can transmit the gene to offspring.

      excludeGeneticFormOfDisease:
        title: genetic form of disease
        description: A grouping class that that is characterized by the feature of having a genetic or inheritable component. We don't include these terms in Mondo because it is a grouping class that is not commonly used.

      excludeGroupingClass:
        title: grouping class

      excludePhenotypeForTumor:
        title: phenotype for tumor
        description: Characteristics of a tumor that causes the disease, but not the disease itself.
