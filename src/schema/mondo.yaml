      excludeBiologicalProcess:
        title: biological process
        description: 'Code used when the term is excluded from Mondo based on the
          fact that the term''s concept is not a disease and describes a biological
          process.

          [From GO:0008150: A biological process represents a specific objective that
          the organism is genetically programmed to achieve. Biological processes
          are often described by their outcome or ending state, e.g., the biological
          process of cell division results in the creation of two daughter cells (a
          divided cell) from a single parent cell. A biological process is accomplished
          by a particular set of molecular functions carried out by specific gene
          products (or macromolecular complexes), often in a highly regulated manner
          and in a particular temporal sequence.]'
        notes: '- This code applies for terms describing a biological process occuring
          "normally" (e.g.  ICD10CM:O00-O9A - Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium)

          - For cases where the biological process occurs "abnormally", MONDO:excludePhenotype
          should be used (e.g. MONDO:0007816 - obsolete immune suppression)

          - For cases where the biological process could be occuring "normally" or
          "abnormally", this code, MONDO:excludeBiologicalProcess, can be used (e.g.
          MONDO:0006185 - obsolete ductal or ductular proliferation)'

      excludeBiomarker:
        title: biomarker
        description: Code used when the term is excluded from Mondo based on the fact
          that the term's concept is not a disease and represents measurable indicator
          of some biological state or condition, such as disease status.
        notes: 'When the term concept represents the biomarker status, one might consider
          using MONDO:excludePhenotype (e.g. ICD10CM:Z17.0 - Estrogen receptor positive
          status [ER+]), or MONDO:excludeRiskFactor (e.g. ICD10CM:Z15.01 - Genetic
          susceptibility to malignant neoplasm of breast; synonym: Brca1 gene mutation
          positive).'

        title: complication
        description: Code used when the term is excluded from Mondo based on the fact
          that the term's concept is not a disease and represents a complication to
          an external procedure (e.g surgery) or events (e.g birth).
        notes: One needs to be careful to not confuse actual "diseases" resulting
          from an event (e.g. injury, disease resulting from infection, or viral sequela).
          In these cases, the representation of the concept in Mondo might be reasonable.
        examples: 'ICD10CM:E36-E36 - Intraoperative complications of endocrine system

          Orphanet:90053 - Complications after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation'

          of an individual that is the product of interactions between genes and the
          environment.
        notes: This code includes concepts representing "features", "symptoms", and
          "clinical finding" describing results of clinical, laboratory, or molecular
          examination.

      excludeRiskFactor:
        title: risk factor
        description: Code used when the term is excluded from Mondo based on the fact
          that the term's concept is not a disease and represents a condition or a

        title: not a disease
        description: Code used when the term is excluded from Mondo based on the fact
          that the term's concept is not a disease.
        notes: This blanket exclusion code is used in cases  when the term represents
          a non disease concept for which a more precise code is unavailable, and/or
          we did not have the resources to determine which more specific exclusion
          code should be used.

        description: Code used when the term is excluded from Mondo based on the fact
          that the term's concept is not a disease and represents factors and/or actions
          that influence health status and might (or might not) be the cause of a
          disease.
        notes: This code should be used when the concept is not clearly a procedure,
          an event, or a medical action, or is a mix of these.

          could result in injury and/or its effect, or represent periods in a disease.

        notes: This blanket exclusion code is used in cases when the term represents
          a grouping term for which no more precise code is available, and/or we did
          not have the resources to determine which more specific exclusion code should
          be used.

          that this term is not a specific disease; it instead groups diseases based
          on shared phenotypes and/or features, which is a disease classification/grouping
          not supported in Mondo.
        notes: When requested by the expert community, terms grouping diseases based
          on phenotype/feature could be included into Mondo. However (1) use case(s)
          for this request is(are) required (since other avenues, such as query through
          disease annotations, might be more appropriate solutions), (2) commitment
          by the requesters to maintain the list of grouped diseases (ie children
          of the grouping term) is requested in order to ensure that this ontology
          branch is correct and complete.
