        title: biological process
        description: 'Code used when the term is excluded from Mondo based on the
          fact that the term''s concept is not a disease and describes a biological
          process.

          [From GO:0008150: A biological process represents a specific objective that
          the organism is genetically programmed to achieve. Biological processes
          are often described by their outcome or ending state, e.g., the biological
          process of cell division results in the creation of two daughter cells (a
          divided cell) from a single parent cell. A biological process is accomplished
          by a particular set of molecular functions carried out by specific gene
          products (or macromolecular complexes), often in a highly regulated manner
          and in a particular temporal sequence.]'
        notes: '- This code applies for terms describing a biological process occuring
          "normally" (e.g.  ICD10CM:O00-O9A - Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium)

          - For cases where the biological process occurs "abnormally", MONDO:excludePhenotype
          should be used (e.g. MONDO:0007816 - obsolete immune suppression)

          - For cases where the biological process could be occuring "normally" or
          "abnormally", this code, MONDO:excludeBiologicalProcess, can be used (e.g.
          MONDO:0006185 - obsolete ductal or ductular proliferation)'

          of some biological state or condition, such as disease status.
        notes: 'When the term concept represents the biomarker status, one might consider
          using MONDO:excludePhenotype (e.g. ICD10CM:Z17.0 - Estrogen receptor positive
          status [ER+]), or MONDO:excludeRiskFactor (e.g. ICD10CM:Z15.01 - Genetic

          that the term's concept is not a disease and represents a complication to
          an external procedure (e.g surgery) or events (e.g birth).
        notes: One needs to be careful to not confuse actual "diseases" resulting
          from an event (e.g. injury, disease resulting from infection, or viral sequela).
          In these cases, the representation of the concept in Mondo might be reasonable.

        description: The concept described is not a disease, it is for individual

      excludeGroupingHeritability:
        title: grouping based on heritability
        description: Code used when the term is excluded from Mondo based on the fact
          that this term is not a specific disease; it instead groups diseases based
          on their heritability feature.
        notes: When requested by the expert community, terms grouping diseases based
          on the heritability type could be included into Mondo. However (1) use case(s)
          for this request is(are) required (since other avenues, such as query through
          disease annotations, might be more appropriate solutions), (2) commitment
          by the requesters to maintain the list of grouped diseases (ie children
          of the grouping term) is requested in order to ensure that this ontology
          branch is correct and complete.

          and sensory neuropathy
