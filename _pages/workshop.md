## Mondo Outreach Calls 2023

The goal of the **Mondo Outreach Calls** is to bring together stakeholders and clinical terminology experts with the goal of discussing specific use cases and requirements, and improving Mondo with a focus of our user needs in mind. Every month we plan to invite a group to present their use case (not necessarily directly related to Mondo), and learn if there is anything we can do from the Mondo technical side to better support them. During the call, the Mondo technical team will give an overview of the latest developments and followed by a ~20 minute  talk + discussion from specific users where we’ll discuss paths forward on how we can work together.

## Mondo Workshops

### Description
The goal of this workshop was to bring together the Mondo team members to define our objectives and highest priorities for the upcoming year (and beyond) and develop a plan, with a timeline and assignments, for actionable tasks. These included but were not limited to 1) aligning with the foundations of ICD11 and 2) improving the Mondo design philosophy.

## Using the Mondo Disease Ontology for Disease Data Curation

### Presenters

Sabrina Toro, Nicole Vasilevsky, Nico Matentzoglu

### Description
This workshop was presented at the virtual [Curating the Clinical Genome conference](https://clinicalgenome.org/about/events/curating-the-clinical-genome-2022/agenda/). 31 participants attended. We introduced participants to Mondo, its advantages, and how it relates to other disease terminologies. The focus will be on disease curation best practices, how to use Mondo to annotate disease data, where to find disease terms, what to do if required terms do not exist in Mondo, and how to request changes or improvements. Mondo is a collaborative and community-developed resource; workshop attendees will learn how to contribute to Mondo. This workshop also introduced the Mondo ontology curation workflow, including new term creation, and how different user requests are reconciled (e.g. disease naming), term obsoletions and merges, and ontology releases. In addition, technical aspects of Mondo, including quality control and automated pipelines, were discussed.

Participants were polled at the beginning of the workshop about their usage and familiarity with Mondo. Participants were either very familiar with ontologies (8 respondents, 50%), or had heard about ontologies but didn’t understand what they were (7 respondents, 44%); one respondent (6%) did not know what ontology is. Half of the respondents use ontologies for curation anytime possible (8 respondents, 50%), while the other half either occasionally use ontologies for curation (4 respondents, 25%) or do not use ontology for data curation (4 respondents, 25%).

Most respondents used Mondo for disease curation (7 respondents, 39%) or knew about Mondo but did not use it (7 respondents, 39%). 2 respondents used Mondo for disease annotations and active members of the Mondo community, 2 respondents were Mondo users for reasons other than curation, and 1 respondent had never heard of Mondo.

Most respondents (13, 72%) had never requested changes to Mondo; the other respondents had either created GitHub issues (4 respondents) and/or contracted the Mondo team (3 respondents).

## Mondo Clinical Reclassification Workshop Part 2

### Description
This workshop is a follow-up to the Mondo Clinical Reclassification Workshop (April 2021).
Mondo was reclassified to create a clinical-centric view (see description [here](https://zenodo.org/record/5273598#.YVtjEWZKj0o)), however, many clinically useful terms are still difficult to find as they are subClasses of general grouping terms such as “disease of anatomical system”.
In this workshop, we will propose an updated top-level classification of Mondo which more closely resembles the clinical view of diseases. We will gather stakeholders and community members for their comments, requests, and input.

### Date and Time
**November 17th, 2021**  
12-2pm PST / 3-5pm EST / 8-10pm UK / 9pm-11pm Europe

## Renal Disease and Phenotype Workshop

### Description

This workshop was hosted by Nicole Vasilevsky (Mondo) and Peter Robinson (Human Phenotype Ontology), and brought together experts in kidney disease clinical care. We discussed improvements to classification of the ['kidney disease' (MONDO:0005240)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mondo/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMONDO_0005240) hierarchy in Mondo. As an outcome of this meeting, the kidney disease hiearchy will be revised in accordance to the classifications described in [Brenner and Rector's The Kidney](https://www.us.elsevierhealth.com/brenner-and-rectors-the-kidney-2-volume-set-9780323532655.html?gclid=CjwKCAjwlrqHBhByEiwAnLmYUCC5SqtlaMQWFvf1qvAu9GbhO3c9VntzXng-TAYftZBPTcu4S5PdVBoC4bUQAvD_BwE) textbook.

## ClinGen Virtual Retreat 2021

### Presentation Title
Mondo Disease Ontology (How ClinGen curators work with the Mondo Disease Ontology, which aims to harmonize disease definitions across the world)

### Presenter
Nicole Vasilevsky

### Description

[ClinGen](https://clinicalgenome.org/) hosted a virtual retreat for all ClinGen contributors June 24-25, 2021. The retreat provided the ClinGen community and collaborators with an event to learn about and share new and existing work, as well as best practices across ClinGen. This presentation discussed the Mondo Disease Ontology, which is used for gene-disease annotations by ClinGen curators. The **retreat agenda** is available [here](https://clinicalgenome.org/about/events/clingen-retreat-2021/agenda/).

### Date and Time

## Mondo Clinical Reclassification Workshop

### Description: 
A workshop with invited members of the community to work on the top-level classification of Mondo. The workshop focused on semantic modeling of disease and defining ontology patterns. There is a great need for expert clinicians to define clinically relevant navigational grouping classes. These top down and bottom up approaches need to meet in the middle harmoniously. This workshop included clinicians and ontologists, as well as expert curators working on genes for clinical utility. As an outcome of this meeting, the Mondo hierarchy was revised in accordance to the classifications described in Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine textbook. See [GitHub tickets](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Harrison+reclassification%22) for more details.

### Date and Time
**April 05, 2021, Monday**  
8am-11am PT / 11am-2pm ET / 4pm-7pm UK / 5pm-8pm Europe

## Mondo Introductory Workshop

### Description: 

The workshop focused on defining ontology patterns and community development processes for ontological disease descriptions. Specifically, there was a need to provision multiple attributes to a disease for computational classification. The attributes need to take into account penetrance, expressivity, genetic variation, histology, biomarkers, temporality, somatic and mosaic characteristics, environmental interactions, etc. There was a need to enable expert curation groups such as in ClinGen, EBI, Orphanet, GARD, MedGen, and OMIM to create disease definitions on the fly, capture the provenance and evidence robustly, and have an identifier for use immediately. This workshop included invited curators, clinicians and ontologists and provided an opportunity to get an overview of Mondo and the source terminologies, as well as networking opportunities.
