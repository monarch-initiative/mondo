### Mondo Workshop

#### Description: 

The workshop focused on defining ontology patterns and community development processes for ontological disease descriptions. Specifically, there was a need to provision multiple attributes to a disease for computational classification. The attributes need to take into account penetrance, expressivity, genetic variation, histology, biomarkers, temporality, somatic and mosaic characteristics, environmental interactions, etc. There was a need to enable expert curation groups such as in ClinGen, EBI, Orphanet, GARD, MedGen, and OMIM to create disease definitions on the fly, capture the provenance and evidence robustly, and have an identifier for use immediately. This workshop included invited curators, clinicians and ontologists and provided an opportunity to get an overview of Mondo and the source terminologies, as well as networking opportunities.

### Mondo Upper Level Reclassification Workshop

#### Description: 
A workshop with invited members of the community to work on the top-level classification of Mondo. The workshop focused on semantic modeling of disease and defining ontology patterns. There is a great need for expert clinicians to define clinically relevant navigational grouping classes. These top down and bottom up approaches need to meet in the middle harmoniously. This workshop included clinicians and ontologists, as well as expert curators working on genes for clinical utility.

#### Date and Time
**April 05, 2021, Monday**  
8am-11am PT / 11am-2pm ET / 4pm-7pm UK / 5pm-8pm Europe
