# Cystic Fibrosis in MONDO & Monarch Initiative: Comprehensive Gap Analysis & Action Plan

**Date:** 2026-02-09 | **Branch:** master

---

## Context

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of cystic fibrosis (CF) representation in the MONDO ontology and Monarch Initiative, compared with current medical literature and key CF resources. The goal is to identify gaps and propose actionable steps to bring MONDO and Monarch up to date.

| MONDO ID | Name | Species |
|----------|------|---------|
| MONDO:1010043 | cystic fibrosis, non-human animal | General |
| MONDO:1010543 | cystic fibrosis, domestic ferret | *Mustela putorius furo* |
| MONDO:1010544 | cystic fibrosis, pig | *Sus scrofa* |
| MONDO:1010545 | cystic fibrosis, sheep | *Ovis aries* |

### 1.4 Key Observations About Current State

- **No CF subtype hierarchy**: MONDO:0009061 has **zero child terms** (no `is_a: MONDO:0009061` anywhere)
- **Only 3 terms** carry direct CFTR gene associations: MONDO:0009061, MONDO:0010178, MONDO:0100627
- **CF definition is sparse**: "characterized by the production of sweat with a high salt content and mucus secretions with an abnormal viscosity" -- missing CFTR gene mention, multi-organ involvement, autosomal recessive, progressive nature
- **CRMS definition has a typo**: says "CRTR gene" instead of "CFTR gene"
- **BESC1 (MONDO:0008887) lacks gene association** despite being linked to CFTR variants in literature
- **CF-associated meconium ileus** has `excluded_subClassOf MONDO:0009061` -- deliberately NOT classified under CF
- **Phenotype (HPO) annotations** are maintained externally in HPOA, not in Mondo OBO file; only HP:0000007 (autosomal recessive inheritance) appears on the CF stanza

---

## PART 2: CF in the Literature

### Definition of Cystic Fibrosis

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiting autosomal recessive disorder in populations of European descent. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the *CFTR* gene (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; HGNC:1884, chromosome 7q31.2), which encodes a chloride and bicarbonate channel expressed in epithelial cells throughout the body. Loss or dysfunction of CFTR disrupts salt, water, and bicarbonate transport across epithelial surfaces, resulting in the production of abnormally thick, dehydrated mucus secretions and elevated sweat chloride concentrations.

CF is a progressive, multi-organ disease primarily affecting:
- **Lungs**: Chronic airway infection, inflammation, bronchiectasis, and progressive respiratory failure (the leading cause of morbidity and mortality)
- **Pancreas**: Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (~85% of patients), leading to maldigestion, malabsorption, and failure to thrive
- **Gastrointestinal tract**: Meconium ileus (15-20% of neonates), distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS)
- **Hepatobiliary system**: CF-related liver disease (5-10%)
- **Reproductive system**: Male infertility due to congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD; ~97-98% of males)
- **Endocrine system**: CF-related diabetes (CFRD; 40-50% of adults)
- **Sweat glands**: Elevated sweat chloride (basis of the diagnostic sweat test)

Diagnosis requires evidence of CFTR dysfunction (sweat chloride >=60 mmol/L, or two CF-causing CFTR variants identified, or abnormal nasal potential difference/intestinal current measurement) plus clinical symptoms consistent with CF. Over 2,100 variants in the CFTR gene have been identified, with F508del accounting for approximately 70% of CF alleles worldwide.

Historically, CF was a fatal childhood disease; current median predicted survival age exceeds 56 years (post-CFTR modulator era). The introduction of highly effective CFTR modulator therapies, particularly elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (Trikafta/Kaftrio), has transformed outcomes for approximately 90% of patients.

### 2.1 Disease Classification Spectrum

The literature recognizes a continuous spectrum of CFTR-related conditions:

```
Classic CF <-> Non-Classic CF <-> CFTR-Related Disorders <-> CRMS/CFSPID <-> CFTR Carrier
```

| Category | Sweat Cl- | Organs | Gene(s) | Typical CFTR Variants | In MONDO? |
|----------|-----------|--------|---------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Classic CF** | >=60 mmol/L | Multi-organ (lungs, pancreas, GI, reproductive, hepatobiliary) | CFTR (HGNC:1884) | 2 CF-causing variants. Most common: **F508del/F508del** (homozygous, ~50% of patients); **F508del/G542X**; **F508del/N1303K**; **F508del/W1282X**; **G542X/G542X** | Yes (MONDO:0009061) |
| **Non-Classic/Atypical CF** | 30-59 mmol/L | Milder, often PS, preserved pancreatic function | CFTR (HGNC:1884) | 1 severe + 1 mild variant. Typical: **F508del/R117H-7T**; **F508del/3849+10kbC>T**; **F508del/A455E**; **F508del/D1152H** | No dedicated term |
| **CFTR-Related Disorder (CFTR-RD)** | Variable | Single-organ | CFTR (HGNC:1884) | 1-2 CFTR variants (often compound het with at least 1 mild) | No umbrella term |
| - CBAVD | Normal/borderline | Reproductive only | CFTR (HGNC:1884) | **F508del/R117H-5T** (most common); **F508del/5T**; compound heterozygotes with mild alleles. ~80% carry >=1 CFTR variant | Yes (MONDO:0010178) |
| - Chronic pancreatitis | Variable | Pancreas only | CFTR (HGNC:1884), also PRSS1 (HGNC:9475), SPINK1 (HGNC:11245) | CFTR variants in ~30% of idiopathic cases. Often: **R117H**, **5T allele**, compound het with mild variants | No CFTR-specific subtype |
| - Disseminated bronchiectasis | Variable | Lungs only | CFTR (HGNC:1884); also ENaC subunit genes: SCNN1A (HGNC:10599), SCNN1B (HGNC:10600), SCNN1G (HGNC:10602) | CFTR: various mild/moderate variants; SCNN1A/B/G variants cause CF-like phenocopies (BESC1-3) | No CFTR-specific subtype |
| **CRMS/CFSPID** | <60 mmol/L | Asymptomatic at screening | CFTR (HGNC:1884) | 2 variants, >=1 of unclear significance (VUS or VVCC per CFTR2). E.g., **F508del/R117H-7T**; **F508del/D1270N**; many rare variants | Partial (MONDO:0100627) |
| **CF-Gastritis-Anemia Syndrome** | Variable | Multi-organ (CF + gastritis + megaloblastic anemia + intellectual disability) | Unknown (reported in consanguineous family) | Not characterized at molecular level | Yes (MONDO:0009062) |

### 2.4 Treatments

#### CFTR Modulators

| Drug | Brand | Year | Target | Eligible Patients |
|------|-------|------|--------|--------------------|
| Ivacaftor | Kalydeco | 2012 | Potentiator (Class III/IV) | G551D, R117H, ~100 variants |
| Lumacaftor/ivacaftor | Orkambi | 2015 | Corrector+potentiator | F508del homozygous |
| Tezacaftor/ivacaftor | Symdeko/Symkevi | 2018 | Corrector+potentiator | F508del homozygous/heterozygous |
| **Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI)** | **Trikafta/Kaftrio** | **2019** | **Triple combo** | **~90% of CF patients** |
| Vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor | Alyftrek | 2024 (FDA) | Next-gen triple combo (once-daily) | Similar to ETI; non-inferior efficacy, better convenience |

ETI has been transformative: +14% ppFEV1, 63% fewer exacerbations, dramatic improvement in quality of life and survival. Alyftrek offers once-daily dosing with similar efficacy.

**Unmet need**: ~10% of CF patients with two Class I nonsense/frameshift variants have no approved modulator therapy. Gene therapy (viral/non-viral vectors, mRNA, CRISPR) remains experimental.

### 2.5 The Modulator-Ineligible Population (~10% of CF Patients)

Approximately 10% of CF patients worldwide carry two "minimal function" Class I variants (nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site mutations that produce no CFTR protein) and are **not eligible for any currently approved CFTR modulator therapy**.

#### Common Class I (nonsense/frameshift) variants:

| Variant | Type | Global Frequency | Geographic Enrichment |
|---------|------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **G542X** | Nonsense (Class I) | ~2.6% of all CF alleles | Mediterranean (Southern Europe, North Africa) |
| **W1282X** | Nonsense (Class I) | ~1.0% | Ashkenazi Jewish populations |
| **R553X** | Nonsense (Class I) | ~0.75% | Northern Europe |
| **621+1G>T** | Splice-site (Class I) | ~0.54% | Southern Europe (Greece ~6.4%) |
| **1717-1G>A** | Splice-site (Class I) | ~0.5% | Various |

#### Experimental Therapeutic Approaches

| Approach | Mechanism | Stage |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Readthrough agents** | Force ribosome to read through premature stop codons | Clinical trials (disappointing) |
| **NMD inhibitors** | Block nonsense-mediated mRNA decay | Preclinical |
| **Gene therapy (viral)** | Deliver functional CFTR gene via viral vector | Phase 1/2 |
| **mRNA therapy** | Inhaled CFTR mRNA in lipid nanoparticles | Preclinical/Phase 1 |
| **Base editing** | Correct specific point mutations using CRISPR base editors | Preclinical |
| **Prime editing** | Precise DNA correction using CRISPR prime editors | Preclinical |

## PART 3: Gap Analysis -- MONDO vs. Literature

### 3.1 Missing Disease Entities (HIGH Priority)

| Gap | Clinical Significance | Verified References | Action |
|-----|----------------------|---------------------|--------|
| **CF-related diabetes (CFRD)** | Affects 40-50% of adults; distinct from type 1/2 diabetes; own clinical guidelines | PMID:21115772, PMID:29515516 | **Create new term** |
| **CFTR-Related Disorder (CFTR-RD) umbrella** | International consensus entity (WHO/ECFS 2010); encompasses CBAVD, chronic pancreatitis, bronchiectasis with CFTR dysfunction | PMID:21658649 | **Create grouping term** |
| **CFSPID designation** missing from CRMS term | International harmonized term is "CRMS/CFSPID"; only US "CRMS" is used | PMID:25630966 | **Add synonym + update name** |

### 3.2 Missing Disease Entities (MEDIUM Priority)

| Gap | Clinical Significance | Verified References | Action |
|-----|----------------------|---------------------|--------|
| **CF liver disease (CFLD)** | 5-10% of CF patients; distinct entity | PMID:28753176 | Consider new term |
| **CFTR-associated pancreatitis** | CFTR variants in ~30% of idiopathic chronic pancreatitis | -- | Consider subtype of MONDO:0008185 |
| **CF-related bone disease** | 50-75% of adults; growing recognition | -- | Consider new term |
| **Non-classic/atypical CF** | Milder presentation, PS, borderline sweat Cl- | GeneReviews | Evaluate if distinct term warranted |

### 3.3 Data Quality Issues

| Issue | Location | Fix |
|-------|----------|-----|
| **Typo in CRMS definition**: "CRTR gene" -> "CFTR gene" | MONDO:0100627 | Edit definition |
| **CF definition too sparse** | MONDO:0009061 | Enhance definition |
| **BESC1 missing gene association** | MONDO:0008887 | Add CFTR gene link (verify with literature) |
| **Missing historical synonyms** | MONDO:0009061 | Add "fibrocystic disease of the pancreas" etc. |

### 3.4 Structural/Classification Observations

| Observation | Assessment |
|-------------|-----------|
| No CF subtype hierarchy (zero children) | May be intentional; discuss whether PI/PS or classic/non-classic subtypes are warranted |
| No CFTR modulator therapy representation | Generally outside ontology scope |
| CF meconium ileus deliberately excluded from CF hierarchy | Curated decision with provenance; reasonable |
| Aquagenic palmoplantar keratoderma mentions CF association but has no formal relationship | Low priority |

### 3.5 Monarch Initiative Coverage Summary

| Aspect | Coverage | Assessment |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Core CF term | Present | GOOD |
| Gene-disease (CFTR-CF) | Present | GOOD |
| CBAVD from CFTR | Present | GOOD |
| CRMS/CFSPID | Partial | Needs update |
| CF subtypes | Absent | No hierarchy |
| CFRD | **Absent** | **MAJOR GAP** |
| CF liver disease | Absent | Gap |
| CFTR-RD umbrella | Absent | Gap |
| CF-like syndromes (BESC) | Present | GOOD |
| HPO phenotype annotations | External (HPOA) | Extensive coverage |
| Non-human animal models | Present | GOOD (3 species) |
| Cross-references | Extensive | EXCELLENT |

### Gene Identifiers

| Gene | HGNC ID | Verified |
|------|---------|----------|
| CFTR | HGNC:1884 | Yes (already in MONDO) |

### Available New Term IDs

Current MONDO:777xxxx IDs in use: MONDO:7770001, MONDO:7770002. The following are available:
- **MONDO:7770003** -- CFRD
- **MONDO:7770004** -- CFTR-RD umbrella
- **MONDO:7770005** -- CFLD

### Phase 1: Quick Fixes (can do now)

#### 1a. Fix CRMS definition typo (MONDO:0100627)

**Current** (line 568323 in mondo-edit.obo):
```
def: "Any metabolic syndrome in which the cause of the disease is a variation in the CRTR gene. ..."
```

**Proposed**:
```
def: "A condition identified in infants with hypertrypsinogenemia on newborn screening who have an inconclusive diagnosis, defined as having a sweat chloride value less than 60 mmol/L and two CFTR variants, at least one of which has unclear phenotypic consequences, and who thus do not meet diagnostic criteria for cystic fibrosis (CF). CRMS is the designation used in the United States; CFSPID (CF screen positive, inconclusive diagnosis) is the international equivalent. A proportion of these infants may later develop CFTR-related symptoms." [PMID:19914443, PMID:25630966]
```

#### 1b. Add CFSPID synonyms to CRMS term (MONDO:0100627)

**Current name**: `CFTR-related metabolic syndrome`

**Proposed name**: `CFTR-related metabolic syndrome/CF screen positive, inconclusive diagnosis`

**Add synonyms**:
```
synonym: "CFSPID" EXACT ABBREVIATION [PMID:25630966]
synonym: "CFTR-related metabolic syndrome" EXACT [PMID:19914443]
synonym: "CRMS/CFSPID" EXACT [PMID:25630966]
synonym: "CF screen positive, inconclusive diagnosis" EXACT [PMID:25630966]
```

#### 1c. Improve CF definition (MONDO:0009061)

**Current** (line 200708):
```
def: "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder characterized by the production of sweat with a high salt content and mucus secretions with an abnormal viscosity." [Orphanet:586, Wikipedia:Cystic_fibrosis]
```

**Proposed**:
```
def: "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the CFTR gene (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), which encodes a chloride and bicarbonate channel expressed in epithelial cells. It is a progressive, multi-organ disease characterized by elevated sweat chloride concentrations, chronic obstructive lung disease with recurrent infections, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, intestinal obstruction (including meconium ileus in neonates), male infertility due to obstructive azoospermia, and hepatobiliary complications. CF is the most common life-limiting autosomal recessive disease in populations of European descent." [PMID:37278811, PMID:27140670, Orphanet:586]
```

#### 1d. Add historical synonym to CF term (MONDO:0009061)

```
synonym: "fibrocystic disease of the pancreas" RELATED [PMID:27140670]
```

### Phase 2: New Term Creation

#### 2a. Create CFRD Term (MONDO:7770003)

CFRD is a distinct clinical entity -- not T1D, not T2D. It arises from progressive fibrotic destruction of the pancreas in CF. In MONDO, the `disease_arises_from_feature` relationship is used for diseases that arise as a consequence of another disease (e.g., `MONDO:0000489` "diabetic encephalopathy" uses `disease_arises_from_feature MONDO:0005015`).

**Proposed stanza**:
```obo
[Term]
id: MONDO:7770003
name: cystic fibrosis-related diabetes
def: "A form of diabetes mellitus unique to individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), arising primarily from progressive fibrotic destruction of the pancreas leading to insulin deficiency, with additional contributions from insulin resistance. CFRD affects approximately 20% of adolescents and 40-50% of adults with CF. It shares features with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes but is a distinct clinical entity with its own diagnostic criteria and management guidelines." [PMID:21115772, PMID:29515516]
synonym: "CF-related diabetes" EXACT [PMID:21115772]
synonym: "CFRD" EXACT ABBREVIATION [PMID:21115772]
xref: ICD10CM:E13 {source="MONDO:equivalentTo"}
is_a: MONDO:0005015 {source="PMID:21115772"} ! diabetes mellitus
intersection_of: MONDO:0005015 ! diabetes mellitus
intersection_of: disease_arises_from_feature MONDO:0009061 ! cystic fibrosis
relationship: disease_arises_from_feature MONDO:0009061 {source="PMID:21115772"} ! cystic fibrosis
property_value: http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator doi:10.1186/s13326-024-00320-3
```

**Parent terms**: `MONDO:0005015` (diabetes mellitus)
**Logical definition**: diabetes mellitus AND disease_arises_from_feature cystic fibrosis
**ICD-10-CM**: E13 (Other specified diabetes mellitus) is commonly used for CFRD coding

**Note**: The ICD10CM:E13 xref needs verification -- it may be `MONDO:relatedTo` rather than `equivalentTo` since E13 encompasses more than just CFRD. This should be confirmed before finalizing.

#### 2b. Create CFTR-RD Umbrella Term (MONDO:7770004)

**Proposed stanza**:
```obo
[Term]
id: MONDO:7770004
name: CFTR-related disorder
def: "A clinical entity associated with CFTR dysfunction that does not fulfill diagnostic criteria for cystic fibrosis. CFTR-related disorders present with clinical evidence of CFTR dysfunction in at least one organ system and have at least one CFTR variant that does not cause cystic fibrosis on the other allele. Examples include congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), chronic pancreatitis associated with CFTR variants, and disseminated bronchiectasis with CFTR dysfunction." [PMID:21658649]
synonym: "CFTR-RD" EXACT ABBREVIATION [PMID:21658649]
synonym: "CFTR-related disease" RELATED [PMID:21658649]
is_a: MONDO:0003847 {source="PMID:21658649"} ! hereditary disease
relationship: has_material_basis_in_germline_mutation_in http://identifiers.org/hgnc/1884 {source="PMID:21658649"} ! CFTR
property_value: http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator doi:10.1186/s13326-024-00320-3
```

**Parent terms**: `MONDO:0003847` (hereditary disease)
**Gene**: CFTR (HGNC:1884)
**Note**: This is a grouping term. MONDO:0010178 (CBAVD from CFTR) would be a natural child, but reclassification should be discussed separately.

#### 2c. Create CFLD Term (MONDO:7770005)

**Proposed stanza**:

name: cystic fibrosis-related liver disease
def: "A liver disorder that arises as a consequence of cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis-related liver disease encompasses a spectrum of hepatobiliary abnormalities caused by CFTR dysfunction in cholangiocytes, including focal biliary cirrhosis, multilobular biliary cirrhosis, hepatic steatosis, and cholangiopathy. It is a significant cause of non-pulmonary morbidity and mortality in CF, affecting approximately 5-10% of CF patients." [PMID:28753176, PMID:37278811]

**Parent terms**: `MONDO:0005154` (liver disorder)
**Logical definition**: liver disorder AND disease_arises_from_feature cystic fibrosis

### Phase 3: Extended Curation (requires community input)

These items are **not** included in the immediate implementation plan but should be tracked for future work:

1. **Evaluate CF-related bone disease term** -- Growing recognition, but may need expert discussion
2. **Evaluate CFTR-associated pancreatitis subtype** -- Discuss with GI experts
3. **Review CF subtype hierarchy** -- Whether PI/PS distinction merits ontological representation
4. **Investigate BESC1 gene association** -- Verify CFTR link for MONDO:0008887
5. **Evaluate non-classic/atypical CF term** -- May be needed for clinical classification
6. **Consider reclassifying CBAVD (MONDO:0010178) under CFTR-RD** -- Would require community discussion

## PART 5: Technical Execution Details

### Workflow

1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b cystic-fibrosis-updates`
2. Check out terms for editing: Use `obo-checkout.pl` if available, otherwise edit mondo-edit.obo directly
3. Apply Phase 1 edits (quick fixes to MONDO:0100627 and MONDO:0009061)
4. Apply Phase 2 edits (insert new terms MONDO:7770003-7770005 after existing MONDO:7770002 block, around line 622750)
5. Normalize: `cd src/ontology && sh run.sh make NORM && mv NORM mondo-edit.obo`
6. Validate syntax: `robot convert --catalog src/ontology/catalog-v001.xml -i src/ontology/mondo-edit.obo -f obo -o mondo-edit.TMP.obo`
7. Commit changes

## Appendix: PMID Corrections from Original Plan

During verification, three PMIDs from the original research plan were found to be **incorrect**:

| Claimed PMID | Claimed Paper | Actual Paper at That PMID | Correct PMID |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| PMID:37191702 | Ong & Ramsey JAMA 2023 CF review | "Excess Mortality...Among Black Population" (Caraballo et al.) | **PMID:37278811** |
| PMID:27527667 | CFRD reference | "Flexible Ureterorenoscopy..." (Dessyn et al., urology) | **PMID:21115772** (ADA/CFF CFRD guidelines) |
| PMID:25953076 | CRMS/CFSPID reference | "Early vaccine availability..." (Greer, influenza) | **PMID:25630966** (Munck et al., CFSPID) |

All PMIDs listed in Part 4 (Implementation Plan) have been verified against PubMed and are correct.
