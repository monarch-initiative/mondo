# High-Level Reclassification of MONDO Human Disease Branch

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive reclassification of the direct subclasses under the MONDO "human disease" branch (MONDO:0700096). The reclassification introduces a new high-level organizational system based on **etiology and pathophysiology** rather than traditional organ system-based classifications.

## Original Structure Analysis

The original human disease branch had 12 direct subclasses with heterogeneous classification criteria:

1. **MONDO:0003900** - connective tissue disorder (anatomical)
2. **MONDO:0005137** - nutritional disorder (etiology)
3. **MONDO:0005219** - breast fibrocystic disease (anatomical/specific)
4. **MONDO:0019040** - chromosomal disorder (genetic)
5. **MONDO:0019303** - premature aging syndrome (functional/genetic)
6. **MONDO:0024623** - otorhinolaryngologic disease (anatomical)
7. **MONDO:0029000** - poisoning (etiology)
8. **MONDO:0043839** - ulcer disease (pathological process)
9. **MONDO:0100081** - sleep disorder (functional)
10. **MONDO:0100086** - perinatal disease (life stage)
11. **MONDO:0700003** - obstetric disorder (life stage)
12. **MONDO:0700220** - disease related to transplantation (iatrogenic)

### Issues with Original Classification

- **Inconsistent classification criteria**: Mixed anatomical, etiological, functional, and life-stage based groupings
- **Heterogeneous granularity**: Some highly specific terms (breast fibrocystic disease) alongside broad categories (chromosomal disorder)
- **Limited scalability**: No clear framework for adding new disease categories
- **Lack of theoretical foundation**: No underlying organizing principle

## New Classification System

### Design Principles

The new high-level classification is based on **etiology and pathophysiology**, providing:
- **Consistent classification criteria** across all categories
- **Theoretical foundation** rooted in disease causation and mechanism
- **Scalability** for future disease classification
- **Clinical utility** aligned with diagnostic and therapeutic approaches

### New High-Level Categories

#### 1. Genetic and Chromosomal Disease (MONDO:1060155)
**Definition**: "Any human disease that results from alterations in genetic material including chromosomal abnormalities, single gene mutations, or other genomic variations. This category encompasses diseases with clear genetic etiology regardless of the specific organ system affected."

**Rationale**: Groups diseases by genetic causation, the most fundamental level of disease etiology.

#### 2. Anatomical System Disease (MONDO:1060156)
**Definition**: "Any human disease that primarily affects specific anatomical systems or structures, organized by the predominant anatomical location or tissue type involved. This includes diseases of connective tissue, sensory organs, and other anatomical structures."

**Rationale**: Maintains anatomical organization for diseases where structure/location is the primary distinguishing feature.

#### 3. Environmental and External Cause Disease (MONDO:1060157)
**Definition**: "Any human disease that results from external factors including toxic exposures, nutritional imbalances, or medical interventions such as transplantation. This category encompasses diseases where the primary etiology involves environmental, nutritional, or iatrogenic factors."

**Rationale**: Groups diseases by external causation, crucial for prevention and public health approaches.

#### 4. Functional and Physiological Disorder (MONDO:1060158)
**Definition**: "Any human disease characterized by disruption of normal physiological functions or processes, including sleep disorders and diseases affecting normal organ function like ulcerative conditions. This category focuses on diseases where functional impairment is the primary pathological mechanism."

**Rationale**: Emphasizes functional/physiological dysfunction as the primary pathological process.

#### 5. Life Stage Related Disease (MONDO:1060160)
**Definition**: "Any human disease that is specifically associated with particular life stages or reproductive processes, including perinatal conditions and obstetric disorders. This category encompasses diseases where the timing of occurrence or relationship to life stage transitions is a defining characteristic."

**Rationale**: Groups diseases by temporal/developmental characteristics unique to specific life stages.

### 1. Genetic and Chromosomal Disease (MONDO:1060155)

| Original ID | Name | Rationale |
|-------------|------|-----------|
| MONDO:0019040 | chromosomal disorder | Clear genetic etiology - chromosomal abnormalities are genomic variations |
| MONDO:0019303 | premature aging syndrome | Often has genetic basis; accelerated aging typically results from genetic defects |

### 2. Anatomical System Disease (MONDO:1060156)

| Original ID | Name | Rationale |
|-------------|------|-----------|
| MONDO:0003900 | connective tissue disorder | Primary classification by anatomical tissue type |
| MONDO:0024623 | otorhinolaryngologic disease | Organization by anatomical system (ENT) |
| MONDO:0005219 | breast fibrocystic disease | Specific anatomical location (breast tissue) |

### 3. Environmental and External Cause Disease (MONDO:1060157)

| Original ID | Name | Rationale |
|-------------|------|-----------|
| MONDO:0029000 | poisoning | Clear external toxic exposure etiology |
| MONDO:0005137 | nutritional disorder | External factor (nutritional intake) as primary cause |
| MONDO:0700220 | disease related to transplantation | Iatrogenic/medical intervention etiology |

### 4. Functional and Physiological Disorder (MONDO:1060158)

| Original ID | Name | Rationale |
|-------------|------|-----------|
