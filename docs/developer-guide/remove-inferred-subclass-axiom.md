# Remove Unwanted Inferred subclassOf Axiom

When there is an inferred subclassOf axiom, and we were asked to remove it, and the problem is fixed, we should add this to the [unwanted subClassOf template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1So-nz9TZNAtJ4o1Ct85LZZMU0Qt5aO2etFwWsQfu0mw/edit#gid=0).

For an example, see [https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/issues/548](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/issues/548).
