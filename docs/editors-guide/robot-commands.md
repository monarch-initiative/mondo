# ROBOT repair

Generic instructions are [here](http://robot.obolibrary.org/repair).

These instructions are for updating axioms pointing to deprecated classes with their replacement class (indicated using [term replaced by](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0100001)).

This situation can arise in a number of different ways:

 1. When you are editing an ontology in Protege, you obsolete a class, but forget to repair axioms that reference this.
 2. When you rebuild an import module using [extract](extract), and the upstream ontology has obsoleted classes that you are using.

For more on obsoletion workflows, see the [obsoletion guide](https://ontology-development-kit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ObsoleteTerm.html) in the Ontology Development Kit documentation.

To repair the Mondo ontology (with the name `need-of-repair.owl`) run the following command:

`robot repair -i mondo-edit.obo -o mondo-edit-repaired.obo`

**Diff:**
You can compare this with the original file by running this command:
diff mondo-edit.obo mondo-edit-repaired.obo

or this command:
diff -u mondo-edit.obo mondo-edit-repaired.obo


If the changes that were made look good then you can simply replace the source file with the repaired file (`mv results/repaired.owl need-of-repair.owl`).

By default, annotation axioms are not migrated to replacement classes. However, this can be enabled for a list of annotation properties passed either as arguments to `--annotation-property` or in a term file `--annotation-properties-file`:
