# Set up new computer 

For ontology curation and development on a Mac. 
We are assuming your default shell is zsh (modern machines use zsh as a shell, older machines use bash). 

## Install brew

1. https://brew.sh/

## Set up docker

- Follow the instructions [here](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac). 
- Once installed, you should be able to open your command line and download the ODK.
  - Open Terminal
  - in the command line type, type `docker pull obolibrary/odkfull`. This will download the ODK (will take a few minutes, depending on you internet connection).

- Setting the memory: 
Set memory ~60% of your system memory, for example, if you have 16GB of RAM, then you should assign 10-11.
