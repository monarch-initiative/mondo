## Revise Terms in Mondo

You may wish to revise existing terms in Mondo. To add a new term or class,
see the instructions [here](https://mondo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/editors-guide/add-new-terms/).

### Revise a superclass/parent

#### The Class description view
Superclasses or parents are added in the Description view in Protege, 
under the 'SubClass Of' panel. In the [add new terms documentation](https://mondo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/editors-guide/add-new-terms/), it describes how to add sub/superclasses and annotate the class hierarchy. Another way revise the superclass is via the Class description view. When an OWL class is selected in the entities view, the right-hand side of the tab shows the class description panel. If we select the 'vertebral column disease' class, we see in the class description view that this class is a "SubClass Of" (= has a SuperClass) the 'musculoskeletal system disease' class. Using the (+) button beside "SubClass Of" we could add another superclass to the 'skeletal system disease' class.

Note the Anonymous Ancestors. These are superclasses that are inherited from the parents. If you hover over the Subclass Of (Anonymous Ancestor) you can see the parent that the class inherited the superclass from.

#### Add a superclass
