| [neoplasm](neoplasm_by_origin/) | TBD. | 
| [nonhuman_disease](nonhuman_disease/) | This pattern should be used for diseases affecting non-human animal which have a corresponding/an analog disease in human, AND the taxon affected is NOT known. Examples: [leukemia, non-human animal](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0700100), [hepatitis, viral, animal](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0025085) | 
| [nonhuman_disease_series_by_gene](nonhuman_disease_series_by_gene/) | This pattern is for non-human diseases that are defined based on a variation in one gene, such as many genetic diseases from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals (OMIA).  Examples: TBD  |

| [nuclear_subtype](nuclear_subtype/) | A disease that is classified as a nuclear subtype, due to a defect in a nuclear gene, such as MONDO:0009640 'mitochondrial complex I deficiency, nuclear type'. | 
| [OMIM_disease_series_by_gene](OMIM_disease_series_by_gene/) | <br/>This pattern is meant to be used for (1) OMIM Mendelian diseases (ie unitary genetic diseases, as described in [PMID:33417889](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7820621/)), including children of OMIM phenotypic series (OMIMPS), which are represented as grouping classes in Mondo, and (2) OMIA Mendelian diseases (https://omia.org/) which are defined by a variation in a gene. Notes about the OMIMPS (see also OMIM_phenotypic_series.yaml):  - every instance of the OMIMPS metaclass should be equivalent to (via annotated xref) to something in OMIMPS namespace - the OMIMPS will never have an asserted causative gene as logical axiom (and no single causative gene in text def) - the OMIMPS must never be equivalent to an OMIM:nnnnnn (often redundant with the above rule) - the OMIMPS must have an acronym synonym, e.g. HPE - the OMIMPS must have two or more subclasses (direct or indirect) that are equivalent to OMIMs and conform to this pattern - the subclasses should (not must) have a logical def that uses the PS as a genus  - the OMIM subclasses must have acronym synonyms that are the parent syn + number, e.g. HPE1, HPE2 - the primary label for the children should also be parent + {"type"} + number - the first member will usually have the same number local ID as the PS Examples: [holoprosencephaly 1](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0009349), [3M syndrome 1](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0010117) | 
| [OMIM_phenotypic_series](OMIM_phenotypic_series/) | This pattern is meant to be used for OMIM phenotypic series (OMIMPS), which are represented as grouping classes in Mondo. Note:  - every instance of this metaclass should be equivalent to (via annotated xref) to something in OMIMPS namespace - it will never have an asserted causative gene as logical axiom (and no single causative gene in text def) - it must never be equivalent to an OMIM:nnnnnn (often redundant with the above rule) - it must have an acronym synonym, e.g. HPE - it must have two or more subclasses (direct or indirect) that are equivalent to OMIMs - the subclasses should (not must) have a logical def that uses the PS as a genus (see [disease_series_by_gene.yaml](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo/patterns/disease_series_by_gene.yaml)) - the OMIM subclasses must have acronym synonyms that are the parent syn + number, e.g. HPE1, HPE2 - the primary label for the children should also be parent + {"type"} + number - the first member will usually have the same number local ID as the PS - the first member in OMIM usually has documentation that is pertinent to the parent PS - the members may(?) generally share high semantic similarity - All OMIMPS disease should have a has characteristic some inherited restricted, see [omimps-should-be-inherited-violation.sparql](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo/sparql/omimps-should-be-inherited-violation.sparql)<br/>Examples: [holoprosencephaly](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0016296) [OMIMPS:236100](https://omim.org/phenotypicSeries/PS236100), '3-M syndrome'(http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0007477) [OMIMPS:236100](https://omim.org/phenotypicSeries/PS273750).  | 
| [partial_chromosomal_deletion](partial_chromosomal_deletion/) | This pattern is meant to be used for chromosomal disorder which consists of the deletion of part of a chromosome in which only the chromosome which part is deleted is known (the chromosomal region is not known). Note that when the chromosomal region is known, the chromosomal_region_deletion pattern should be used. Also note that this pattern does not include the loss of the entire chromosome (monosomy). | 
| [pentasomy](pentasomy/) | This pattern is meant to be used for chromosomal disorder which consists of the presence of three additional chromosomes of the same type from the normal diploid number. Note that the presence of additional chromosomes refers to the entire chromosome, and not to part of a chromosome. |

| [severe](severe/) | Pattern for describing the severity of a disease, in this case, a severe form of the disease. Here severe means having a high degree of severity. This may correspond with specific genetic mutations (or homozygous or heterozygous forms).<br/>Examples: [severe ichthyosis vulgaris](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0100475) | 
| [small cell carcinoma disease has location X](small_cell_carcinoma/) | This is auto-generated.

| [susceptibility_by_gene](susceptibility_by_gene/) | This pattern should be used for terms in which a gene dysfunction causes a predisposition or susceptibility towards developing a specific disease. This pattern is a sub-pattern of [inherited_susceptibility.yaml](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/blob/master/src/patterns/dosdp-patterns/inherited_susceptibility.yaml)<br/>Examples - [autism, susceptibility to, X-linked 5](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0010449), [bulimia nervosa, susceptibility to, 2](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0012461), [nephrolithiasis susceptibility caused by SLC26A1](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0020722)' | 
| [syndromic](syndromic/) | Some diseases exist in both isolated and syndromic forms. For example, aniridia ([MONDO_0019172 aniridia](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0019172), [MONDO_0020148'syndromic aniridia'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0020148) and [MONDO_0007119 'isolated aniridia'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0007119). Use this pattern to define the syndromic form of a disease when a term exists for the isolated/syndromic-neutral version. In general, this pattern should be used in parallel with isolated. E.g. if you make a term 'syndromic disease, you should also have 'isolated disease' [see pattern here(https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/blob/master/src/patterns/dosdp-patterns/isolated.yaml). <br/>Note that the isolated and syndromic forms will be inferred to be disjoint due to the GCI pattern. | 
| [tetrasomy](tetrasomy/) | This pattern is meant to be used for chromosomal disorder which consists of the presence of two additional chromosomes of the same type from the normal diploid number. Note that the presence of additional chromosomes refers to the entire chromosome, and not to part of a chromosome. |
