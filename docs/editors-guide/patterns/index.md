| [OMIM_phenotypic_series](OMIM_phenotypic_series/) | This pattern is meant to be used for OMIM phenotypic series (OMIMPS), which are represented as grouping classes in Mondo. Note:  - every instance of this metaclass should be equivalent to (via annotated xref) to something in OMIMPS namespace - it will never have an asserted causative gene as logical axiom (and no single causative gene in text def) - it must never be equivalent to an OMIM:nnnnnn (often redundant with the above rule) - it must have an acronym synonym, e.g. HPE - it must have two or more subclasses (direct or indirect) that are equivalent to OMIMs - the subclasses should (not must) have a logical def that uses the PS as a genus (see [disease_series_by_gene.yaml](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo/patterns/disease_series_by_gene.yaml)) - the OMIM subclasses must have acronym synonyms that are the parent syn + number, e.g. HPE1, HPE2 - the primary label for the children should also be parent + {"type"} + number - the first member will usually have the same number local ID as the PS - the first member in OMIM usually has documentation that is pertinent to the parent PS - the members may(?) generally share high semantic similarity - All OMIMPS disease should have a has modifier some inherited restricted, see [omimps-should-be-inherited-violation.sparql](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo/sparql/omimps-should-be-inherited-violation.sparql)<br/>Examples: [holoprosencephaly](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0016296) [OMIMPS:236100](https://omim.org/phenotypicSeries/PS236100), '3-M syndrome'(http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0007477) [OMIMPS:236100](https://omim.org/phenotypicSeries/PS273750).  |

| [postinfectious_disease](postinfectious_disease/) | A design pattern for conditions such as post-herpetic neuralgia or postinfectious encephalitis, where the disease is secondary to the initial infection.<br/>TODO: write better guidelines on what constitutes a secondary disease vs primary. * We do not use this pattern for AIDS-HIV for example, instead representing this is using SubClassOf. * We draw a distinction between infectious and postinfectious encepahlitis. * we do not use this pattern for chickenpox, but we do for shingles  | 
| [primary infectious](primary_infectious/) | <br/>Pattern for extending a disease class to a primary infectious form, a characteristic of an infectious disease in which the disease affects an immunologically normal host. Example: MONDO_0000308 'primary systemic mycosis'. | 
| [rare](rare/) | TBD. | 
| [rare_genetic](rare_genetic/) | TBD. | 
| [refractory](refractory/) | TBD. | 
| [rhabdomyosarcoma disease has location X](rhabdomyosarcoma/) | This is auto-generated. Add your description here<br/>Examples: [rhabdomyosarcoma of the cervix uteri](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0016282), [breast rhabdomyosarcoma](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0002859), [testis rhabdomyosarcoma](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0002860) (15 total) | 
| [sarcoma](sarcoma/) | <br/>Sarcomas are malignant neoplasms arising from soft tissue or bone.<br/>This is a design pattern for classes representing sarcomas based on their location. This may be the site of origin, but it can also represent a secondary site for metastatized sarcma.<br/>We use the generic 'disease has location' relation, which generalized over primary and secondary sites. | 
| [small cell carcinoma disease has location X](small_cell_carcinoma/) | This is auto-generated. Add your description here<br/>Examples: [cervical small cell carcinoma](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0006142), [pancreatic small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0006348), [ureter small cell carcinoma](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0006482) (16 total) | 
| [specific_infectious_disease_by_location](specific_infectious_disease_by_location/) | <br/>TODO | 
| [specific_inflammatory_disease_by_site](specific_infectious_disease_by_agent/) | <br/>as for inflammatory_disease_by_site, but refining a specific disease | 
| [specific_inflammatory_disease_by_site](specific_inflammatory_disease_by_site/) | <br/>as for inflammatory_disease_by_site, but refining a specific disease | 
| [squamous cell carcinoma disease has location X](squamous_cell_carcinoma/) | This is auto-generated. Add your description here<br/>Examples: [cervical squamous cell carcinoma](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0006143), [skin squamous cell carcinoma](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0002529), [ureter squamous cell carcinoma](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0003502) (63 total) | 
| [substance_abuse](substance_abuse/) | A substance abuse that specifies a specific environmental stimulus such as alcohol, cocaine, etc. Examples: [alcohol abuse](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0002046), [cocaine abuse](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0004456) | 
| [susceptibility_by_gene](susceptibility_by_gene/) | This pattern should be used for terms in which a gene dysfunction causes a predisposition or susceptibility towards developing a specific disease. This pattern is a sub-pattern of [inherited_susceptibility.yaml](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/blob/master/src/patterns/dosdp-patterns/inherited_susceptibility.yaml) | 
| [syndromic](syndromic/) | Some diseases exist in both isolated and syndromic forms. For example, aniridia ([MONDO_0019172 aniridia](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0019172), [MONDO_0020148'syndromic aniridia'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0020148) and [MONDO_0007119 'isolated aniridia'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0007119). Use this pattern to define the syndromic form of a disease when a term exists for the isolated/syndromic-neutral version. In general, this pattern should be used in parallel with isolated. E.g. if you make a term 'syndromic disease, you should also have 'isolated disease' [see pattern here(https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/blob/master/src/patterns/dosdp-patterns/isolated.yaml). <br/>Note that the isolated and syndromic forms will be inferred to be disjoint due to the GCI pattern. | 
| [vectorBorneDisease](vectorBorneDisease/) | An infectious disease where a pathogen is carried and transmitted by another organism that acts as disease vector. Examples: MONDO_0020601 'mosquito-borne viral encephalitis', MONDO_0017572 'tick-borne encephalitis' | 
| [X disease disrupts X](specific_disease_by_disrupted_process/) | This is auto-generated.
