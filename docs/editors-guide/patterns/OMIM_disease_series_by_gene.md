# OMIM_disease_series_by_gene 

[http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo/patterns/disease_series_by_gene.yaml](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo/patterns/disease_series_by_gene.yaml)
## Description 



This pattern is meant to be used for OMIM Mendelian diseases (ie unitary genetic diseases, as described in [PMID:33417889](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7820621/)), including children of OMIM phenotypic series (OMIMPS), which are represented as grouping classes in Mondo. Notes about the OMIMPS (see also OMIM_phenotypic_series.yaml):  - every instance of the OMIMPS metaclass should be equivalent to (via annotated xref) to something in OMIMPS namespace - the OMIMPS will never have an asserted causative gene as logical axiom (and no single causative gene in text def) - the OMIMPS must never be equivalent to an OMIM:nnnnnn (often redundant with the above rule) - the OMIMPS must have an acronym synonym, e.g. HPE - the OMIMPS must have two or more subclasses (direct or indirect) that are equivalent to OMIMs and conform to this pattern - the subclasses should (not must) have a logical def that uses the PS as a genus  - the OMIM subclasses must have acronym synonyms that are the parent syn + number, e.g. HPE1, HPE2 - the primary label for the children should also be parent + {"type"} + number - the first member will usually have the same number local ID as the PS Examples: [holoprosencephaly 1](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0009349), [3M syndrome 1](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0010117)
