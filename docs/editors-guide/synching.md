# Ingest source terms into Mondo
_Updated 2022-04-11_

## There are three phases of ingesting source terms into Mondo:

1. **Mapping** creates links between existing Mondo classes and external ids
2. **"Migrating"** or **"syncing"** updates the content of Mondo in the light of changes to sources. For example a subclassOf axiom previously supported by ORDO may have been removed in the latest release. If ORDO was the only source supporting that axiom, we may want to also drop it.
3. **Slurping** moves an entire term over from a source, if no suitable mapping was found. It is almost like migrating, but it involves some additional tasks, like “minting” a new Mondo ID, adding a candidate rdfs:label (during migration, we will never change the rdfs:label of a term).

### OMIM sync/slurp
Further instructions for the **OMIM sync/slurp** are documented [here](https://mondo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/editors-guide/omim-slurp/).

## Definitions (Under development)

The approach to handling definitions is under development. Potential approaches are:
1. We could check if a definition is present, and if it is present choose not to migrate a definition from the source under consideration. This requires keeping some kind of if-else logic in the migration code. 
2. Alternatively, we could create a new annotation property like "definitionAtSource" or something and add all definitions from each source.
