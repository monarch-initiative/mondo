# Source Term Exclusion

## Description

Mondo imports terms from multiple sources (e.g. ICD10CM, Orphanet,...). These sources contain terms which’s concept is out of scope for Mondo, and therefore should not be imported. These excluded terms are recorded in “exclusion lists”.

These exclusion lists include :
  - term_ID: identifier of the term at the source
  - term_label: term label at the source
  - exclusion_reason: reason(s) for excluding the term in Mondo. The exclusion reason should a code from the table below
  - exclude_children: true or false, this field indicates whether the children of this term should also be excluded from Mondo. This field is only applicable when the source of the term is an ontology.

Exclusion lists are in the .tsv format and maintained in this folder: `mondo-ingest/src/ontology/config/`. Each source has its own term exclusion list(e.g [mondo-ingest/src/ontology/config/icd10cm_exclusions.tsv](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo-ingest/blob/main/src/ontology/config/icd10cm_exclusions.tsv))

**Updating the source exclusion list:**
Curators should update the exclusion list by updating the .tsv file. For example, the excluded ICD10CM terms list should be done by updating the following file: `mondo-ingest/src/ontology/config/icd10cm_exclusions.tsv`
Note that these updates should be associated with a PR in Github, such that we are able to review changes history.


## Exclusion Reasons
_This document is a work in progress._ Noted below are reasons for excluding external ontology or terminology terms from Mondo. See enum file [here](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/blob/master/src/schema/mondo.yaml). The dashes in column 1 are meant to indicate the code is a subtype of the code above.

Biological processes are often described by their outcome or ending state, e.g., the biological process of cell division results in the creation of two daughter cells (a divided cell) from a single parent cell. A biological process is accomplished by a particular set of molecular functions carried out by specific gene products (or macromolecular complexes), often in a highly regulated manner and in a particular temporal sequence.] | - This code applies for terms describing a biological process occurring "normally" (e.g.  ICD10CM:O00-O9A - Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium) - For cases where the biological process occurs "abnormally", MONDO:excludePhenotype should be used (e.g. MONDO:0007816 - obsolete immune suppression) - For cases where the biological process could be occurring "normally" or "abnormally", this code, MONDO:excludeBiologicalProcess, can be used (e.g. MONDO:0006185 - obsolete ductal or ductular proliferation)  | ICD10CM:O00-O9A - Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                     TRUE                                    |
