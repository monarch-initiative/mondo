# Mass obsoletion pipeline

## Review branches

1. In this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xTfYCOCGKx_svNT8PirgGDiCINV7IDqzhBk76DNe150/edit#gid=0), there are branches with children that are prioritized for obsoletion.
2. Each branch has a corresponding GitHub ticket and an assigned curator (assigned in GitHub) and a corresponding spreadsheet that lists terms that will either be:
- orphaned
- leave the branch
- stay in the branch

### Review and reassign superclasses to orphaned terms

1. review terms that will become orphaned when the terms are mass obsoleted
2. assign a new parent to each term
3. See [video here]() for more detail_dystonias
