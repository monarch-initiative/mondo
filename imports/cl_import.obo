def: "A material entity of anatomical origin (part of or deriving from an organism) that has as its parts a maximally connected cell compartment surrounded by a plasma membrane." [CARO:mah]
comment: The definition of cell is intended to represent all cells, and thus a cell is defined as a material entity and not an anatomical structure, which implies that it is part of an organism (or the entirety of one).

def: "A cell that is found in a natural setting, which includes multicellular organism cells 'in vivo' (i.e. part of an organism), and unicellular organisms 'in environment' (i.e. part of a natural environment)." [CARO:mah]
comment: To accommodate unicellular organisms better, 'cell in vivo' has been re-labeled 'native cell' to better represent its intended meaning - that is, that it is a cell in the context of a multicellular organism or in a natural environment. 'Native' is intended to contrast with 'in vitro', which refers to cells or other biological entities that have been intentionally placed in a controlled, non-natural setting for the purpose of study or manipulation.

def: "A cell that is found in almost all tissues containing numerous basophilic granules and capable of releasing large amounts of histamine and heparin upon activation. Progenitors leave bone marrow and mature in connective and mucosal tissue. Mature mast cells are found in all tissues, except the bloodstream. Their phenotype is CD117-high, CD123-negative, CD193-positive, CD200R3-positive, and FceRI-high. Stem-cell factor (KIT-ligand; SCF) is the main controlling signal of their survival and development."

comment: Mast cells are generally integrin beta-7-negative and positive for TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7, TLR9, C3aR, C5aR, CR3, CR4, VEGF, FGF2, and renin. They can express MHC Class I and II on their surface. Activated murine mast cells (IgE+Antigen) were capable of expressing the following co-stimulatory molecules: CD95 (Fas), CD120b, CD137 (4-1BB), CD153 (CD30L), CD154 (CD40L), GITR, ICOSL, OX40L, PD-L1, and PD-L2. Note that there was some mouse strain variation. Mast cells have also been demonstrated to produce bFGF, CCL2, CCL4, CCL5, CCL11, CCL20, CXCL2, CXCL8, CXCL10, GM-CSF, IFN-gamma, IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-8, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12, IL-13, IL-16, IL-25, IL-18, MIP-1, prostaglandin D2, SCF, TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, TSLP, VEGF, and XCL1. They express the transcription factors Transcription factors AP-1, GATA1, MITF, Notch2, PIAS3, PU.1, and STAT5.

comment: From FMA: 9.07.2001: Endothelial cell has always been classified as a kind of epithelial cell, specifically a squamous cell but that is not true. First, endothelial cell can either be squamous or cuboidal (e.g. high-endothelial cell) and secondly, it has different embryological derivation (mesodermal) than a true epithelial cell (ectodermal and endodermal). The basis for present classification is the fact that it comprises the outermost layer or lining of anatomical structures (location-based) but a better structural basis for the differentia is the cytoskeleton of the cell. Endothelial cell has vimentin filaments while an epithelial cell has keratin filaments. [Onard].

Cardiocyte on the other hand is any cell in the heart which includes cells other than muscle cells (e.g. endothelial cell of endocardium). Unless there is a consensus among anatomists that cardiocytes refer only to muscle cells, we will treat them as a general class of cells in the heart.
