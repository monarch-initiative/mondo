| MONDO:0000291 | granulomatous amebic encephalitis | Granulomatous amebic encephalitis is a life-threatening infection of the brain caused by the free-living amoebae Acanthamoeba spp., Balamuthia mandrillaris and Sappinia pedata. Acanthamoeba species, are commonly found in lakes, swimming pools, tap water, and heating and air conditioning units. The disease affects immunocompromised peple and is very serious. Symptoms include mental status changes, loss of coordination, fever, muscular weakness or partial paralysis affecting one side of the body, double vision, sensitivity to light and other neurologic problems. The diagnosis is difficult and is often made at advanced stages. Tests useful in the diagnosis include brain scans, biopsies, or spinal taps and in disseminated disease, biopsy of the involved sites and testing by the laboratory experts. Early diagnosis is important for the prognosis. No single drug is effective; hence multiple antibiotics are needed for successful treatment. A combination of surgical and medical interventions involving multiple specialty experts is required to prevent death and morbidity in survivors. | Granulomatous amebic encephalitis is a life-threatening infection of the brain caused by the free-living amoebae Acanthamoeba spp., Balamuthia mandrillaris and Sappinia pedata.

In the absence of associated cardiac malformation (isolated UAPA; IUAPA), the condition may be asymptomatic until adult age. | A rare vascular anomaly characterized by congenital absence of the right or left pulmonary artery, usually ending within 2 cm of its expected origin from the pulmonary trunk. Patients often also have other cardiovascular abnormalities and respective symptoms and are then typically diagnosed in infancy or childhood, while isolated cases generally present with a mild clinical course and may go undiagnosed until adulthood. Presenting clinical features in isolated cases include hemoptysis, exertional dyspnea, and recurrent respiratory infections. The condition is typically accompanied by marked changes of lung tissue and may, if unrecognized, result in massive hemoptysis and pulmonary hypertension. |

| MONDO:0700247 | RAB18 deficiency | Group of diseases encompassing a spectrum of disorders characterized by Warburg Micro Syndrome (characterized by eye, nervous system, and endocrine abnormalities) and Martsolf Syndrome phenotypes (characterized by similar – but milder – findings). To date Warburg micro syndrome comprises >96% of reported individuals with genetically defined RAB18 deficiency. The hallmark ophthalmologic findings are bilateral congenital cataracts, usually accompanied by microphthalmia, microcornea (diameter <10), and small atonic pupils. Poor vision despite early cataract surgery likely results from progressive optic atrophy and cortical visual impairment. Individuals with Warburg micro syndrome have severe to profound intellectual disability (ID); those with Martsolf syndrome have mild to moderate ID. Some individuals with RAB18 deficiency also have epilepsy. In Warburg micro syndrome, a progressive ascending spastic paraplegia typically begins with spastic diplegia and contractures during the first year, followed by upper-limb involvement leading to spastic quadriplegia after about age five years, often eventually causing breathing difficulties. In Martsolf syndrome infantile hypotonia is followed primarily by slowly progressive lower-limb spasticity. Hypogonadism – when present – manifests in both syndromes, in males as micropenis and/or cryptorchidism and in females as hypoplastic labia minora, clitoral hypoplasia, and small introitus. |

| MONDO:0100524 | ASAH1-related sphingolipidosis | A spectrum of disorders that includes Farber disease and spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy. Both disorders are caused by mutations in the ASAH1 gene that encodes the lysosomal hydrolase that breaks down the bioactive lipid, ceramide. |
| MONDO:0100525 | TCF7L2-related neurodevelopmental disorder | A newly discovered disorder caused by a change (variant or mutation) in the TCF7L2 gene. This mutation may be responsible for developmental delays in childhood, intellectual disability, autism, myopia, ADHD, abnormal physical features and other problems. There is a wide spectrum of severity for individuals affected with TRND. Many of the symptoms of TRND overlap with other neurodevelopmental disorders. TRND must be diagnosed with a genetic test and cannot be diagnosed by symptoms alone. |

| MONDO:0100528 | Hao-Fountain syndrome due to 16p13.2 microdeletion | A partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 16 characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech delay, autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, hypogonadism, and hypotonia. The behavioral profile includes impulsivity, compulsivity, stubbornness, manipulative behaviors, temper tantrums, and aggressive behaviors. |
| MONDO:0800448 | leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter | A new leukoencephalopathy, the CACH syndrome (Childhood Ataxia with Central nervous system Hypomyelination) or VWM (Vanishing White Matter) was identified on clinical and MRI criteria. Classically, this disease is characterized by (1) an onset between 2 and 5 years of age, with a cerebello-spastic syndrome exacerbated by episodes of fever or head trauma leading to death after 5 to 10 years of disease evolution, (2) a diffuse involvement of the white matter on cerebral MRI with a CSF-like signal intensity (cavitation), (3) a recessive autosomal mode of inheritance, (4) neuropathologic findings consistent with a cavitating orthochromatic leukodystrophy with increased number of oligodendrocytes with sometimes \foamy'' aspect." |

| MONDO:0006649 | anterior ischemic optic neuropathy | Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) is an eye disease characterized by infarction of the optic disk leading to vision loss. It can be nonarteritic (nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy or NAION) or arteritic, the latter being associated with giant cell arteritis (GCA; often termed temporal arteritis). Vision loss with both varieties is typically rapid (over minutes, hours, or days) and painless. Symptoms such as a general feeling of being unwell (malaise), muscle aches and pains, headaches over the temple, pain when combing hair, pain in the jaw after chewing, and tenderness over the temporal artery (one of the major arteries of the head) may be present with giant cell arteritis. At exam, visual acuity is reduced and the optic disc is swollen. In both subtypes, visual field examination is often reduced in the inferior and central visual fields. The visual loss is usually permanent, with some recovery possibly occurring within the first weeks or months. The arteritic variety is treated with corticosteroids. Treatment of the nonarteritic variety withaspirinor corticosteroids has not been helpful. | Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) is an eye disease characterized by infarction of the optic disk leading to vision loss.

| MONDO:0020048 | internal carotid agenesis | Internal carotid artery (ICA) agenesis (uni or bilateral) is a developmental defect that may be asymptomatic or lead to cerebrovascular lesions. It is a rare malformation, with only around hundred cases reported in the literature. When symptoms are present, they are caused by cerebrovascular insufficiency, compression of the brain by vessels that dilate to compensate for the absence of the ICA, or the presence of an aneurysm. Associated intracranial aneurysms occur in 25 to 35% of patients and are often responsible for intracranial hemorrhage, which may present as the initial symptom. The absence of the ICA is the result of either agenesis or aplasia. The term agenesis is used when both the ICA and its bony canal are absent, whereas there is some evidence of carotid canals in cases of aplasia. The absence of the ICA can be detected by angiography or by computerised tomography. | Internal carotid artery (ICA) agenesis (uni or bilateral) is a developmental defect that may be asymptomatic or lead to cerebrovascular lesions.

|:---|:---|:---|
| MONDO:0100513 | TRAF3 haploinsufficiency | Any Mendelian disease in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the TRAF3 gene. TRAF3 haploinsufficiency caused by heterozygous loss of function (null) variants presents as an immune dysregulation syndrome of recurrent bacterial infections, autoimmunity, systemic inflammation, B cell lymphoproliferation, and hypergammaglobulinemia. |
| MONDO:0100519 | epilepsy, idiopathic generalized, susceptibility to, 17 | |
| MONDO:0100520 | NKX2-1 related choreoathetosis and congenital hypothyroidism with or without pulmonary dysfunction | The NKX2-1 gene is located on chromosome 14 at 14q13.3 and encodes the NK2 homeobox 1 protein, a transcription factor that binds and activates thyroid specific genes. NKX2-1 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant NKX2-1 related choreoathetosis and congenital hypothyroidism with or without pulmonary dysfunction in 1998. |
| MONDO:0100521 | NOG-related symphalangism spectrum disorder | An autosomal dominant condition caused by pathogenic variants of the NOG gene, encoding the noggin protein. Five overlapping clinical syndromes associated with NOG mutations have been described; proximal symphalangism, multiple synostoses syndrome 1, tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome, stapes ankylosis with broad thumbs and toes, and brachydactyly type B2. NOG-related symphalangism spectrum disorder is a new term initially proposed by Potti et al., 2011 to encompass these disorders. NOG-SSD is characterized by proximal symphalangism, conductive deafness caused by stapes ankylosis, ocular abnormality such as hyperopia and strabismus, and characteristic facial features including a broad, tubular-shaped nose and a thin upper vermilion. |

| MONDO:0800119 | postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans | An irreversible obstructive lung disease characterized by subepithelial inflammation and fibrotic narrowing of the bronchioles after lower respiratory tract infection during childhood, especially early childhood. Although diagnosis of PIBO should be confirmed by histopathology, it is generally based on history and clinical findings. Irreversible airway obstruction is demonstrated by decreased forced expiratory volume in 1 second with an absent bronchodilator response, and by mosaic perfusion, air trapping, and/or bronchiectasis on computed tomography images. However, lung function tests using spirometry are not feasible in young children, and most cases of PIBO develop during early childhood. |
| MONDO:0800120 | Mac-Leod-Swyer-James-Syndrome | A rare lung condidtion characterized by often predominantly unilateral lung hyperlucency and air trapping. The condition is a post-infectious form of bronchiolitis obliterans and typically follows a viral respiratory infection in infancy and childhood. Adenovirus infection is considered the most usual epidemiology. In SJS, the involved lung or portion of the lung does not grow normally and is slightly smaller than the opposite lung: in particular, peripheral branches of the pulmonary vessels do not develop, and vasculature is arreseted at the stage at which the infection occurred. Patients respond well to management with bronchodilators, even though this is not primarily a bronchial abnormality. |

Additional manifestations may include inflammation of the optic nerve, intracranial hemorrhage, and lipodystrophy. |
| MONDO:0800130 | autoinflammatory syndrome with immunodeficiency | An autoinflammatory syndrome characterized by onset of various autoimmune features usually in the first decades of life, although later onset has been reported. Typical features include autoimmune cytopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphadenopathy. More variable features may include autoimmune thyroiditis, psoriasis or eczema, nephritis, hepatitis, and symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SL). Some patients may have recurrent infections or exacerbation of the disease with acute infection. Laboratory studies show variable findings, often decreased numbers of naive B cells, lymphopenia with skewed subsets, hypogammaglobulinemia, presence of autoantibodies, and a hyperinflammatory state. The disorder shows autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance. |
| MONDO:0800131 | hyper-IgE recurrent infection syndrome 4A, autosomal dominant | An immunologic disorder characterized by recurrent mainly sinopulmonary infections associated with increased serum IgE. The phenotype is variable, even within families. Some patients have onset of symptoms in early childhood and develop complications, including bronchiectasis or hemoptysis, whereas others have later onset of less severe infections. Immunologic workup usually shows normal leukocyte levels, although some patients may demonstrate alterations in lymphocyte subsets, including T cells. Affected individuals also have variable skeletal abnormalities, including high-arched palate, hyperextensible joints, scoliosis, and bone fractures. The IL6ST mutations are loss-of-function, although the truncated mutant proteins are expressed and interfere with the wildtype protein in a dominant-negative manner by disrupting IL6 and IL11 signaling. |
| MONDO:0800132 | autoinflammatory-pancytopenia syndrome due to DNASE2 deficiency | An autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe anemia and thrombocytopenia apparent from early infancy, hepatosplenomegaly, and recurrent fevers associated with a hyperinflammatory state. Additional systemic features may include chronic diarrhea, proteinuria with renal disease, liver fibrosis with elevated liver enzymes, deforming arthropathy, and vasculitic skin lesions. Some patients may have motor delay or learning difficulties associated with subcortical white matter lesions on brain imaging. Laboratory studies show increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), consistent with a type I interferonopathy. |

Both the size and the weight of the lung are reduced. The true prevalence is not well known (1.4% of all births according to Knox et al. 13), but in cases of premature rupture of membranes at 15-28 weeks gestation, the reported prevalence of pulmonary hypoplasia ranges from 9 to 28%. Factors that contribute to pulmonary hypoplasia include adequate volume of the thoracic cavity, pulmonary fluid dynamics, and abnormal fetal breathing movements. |
| MONDO:0800174 | encephalitis, acute, infection-induced, susceptibility to | An inherited susceptibility or predisposition to developing encephalitis, acute, infection-induced. |
| MONDO:0800175 | cardiogenic shock | A rare, cardiac condition characterized by severely decreased cardiac output, hypoperfusion and end-organ dysfunction, in the presence of adequate intravascular volume.

| MONDO:0030378 | combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency 53 | | An autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hypomyelination, microcephaly, liver dysfunction, and recurrent hypomyelination. |
| MONDO:0030457 | immunodeficiency 87 and autoimmunity | | An autosomal recessive immunologic disorder with wide phenotypic variation and severity. Affected individuals usually present in infancy or early childhood with increased susceptibility to infections, often Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), as well as with lymphadenopathy or autoimmune manifestations, predominantly hemolytic anemia. Laboratory studies may show low or normal lymphocyte numbers, often with skewed T-cell subset ratios. The disorder results primarily from defects in T-cell function, which causes both immunodeficiency and overall immune dysregulation. |
| MONDO:0030483 | immunodeficiency 88 | | An autosomal recessive immune disorder characterized specifically by the development of disseminated mycobacterial disease following vaccination with BCG. The single patient described did not develop other clinical infectious diseases, although serology documented exposure to various viruses and bacteria. Immunologic workup shows defective development of certain innate immunologic cells and decreased production of gamma-interferon (IFNG). Additional manifestations include persistent reactive airway disease associated with increased production of Th2 cytokines. |
| MONDO:0030498 | immunodeficiency 92 | | An autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency characterized by the onset of recurrent infections in infancy or early childhood. Infectious agents are broad, including bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic, including Cryptosporidium and Mycobacteria. Patient lymphocytes show defects in both T- and B-cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, and overall function, and there is also evidence of dysfunction of NK, certain antigen-presenting cells, and myeloid subsets. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be curative. |
| MONDO:0030519 | agammaglobulinemia 9, autosomal recessive | | An autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent bacterial infections associated with agammaglobulinemia and absence of circulating B cells. Additional features include failure to thrive and skin involvement. The severity is variable: more severe cases may require hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, whereas others can be treated effectively with Ig replacement therapy. |
| MONDO:0030528 | immunodeficiency 93 and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy | | An autosomal recessive disorder characterized by onset of recurrent viral and bacterial infections, particularly with encapsulated bacteria, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the first months or years of life. Immunologic workup typically shows decreased circulating B cells and hypo- or agammaglobulinemia, sometimes with neutropenia or T-cell lymphocytosis, although laboratory findings may be variable among patients. Ig replacement therapy is beneficial. Cardiac involvement can also include atrial septal defect, valvular insufficiency, and pre-excitation syndrome. Rare myopathic or neurologic involvement has been reported, but these features are not consistently part of the disorder and may be related to other genetic defects. |
| MONDO:0030529 | agammaglobulinemia 10, autosomal dominant | | An agammaglobulinemia characterized by early-childhood onset of recurrent viral and bacterial infections affecting various organ systems, particularly the sinopulmonary system. Laboratory studies show low or absent circulating B cells and hypo- or agammaglobulinemia. Affected individuals may have adverse reactions to certain vaccinations, such as the polio vaccine. Treatment with replacement Ig is effective; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has also been reported. |
| MONDO:0030693 | immunodeficiency 96 | | An autosomal recessive disorder characterized by onset of recurrent, usually viral, respiratory infections in infancy or early childhood. Other infections, including gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections, may also occur. Laboratory studies show hypogammaglobulinemia, lymphopenia with increased gamma/delta T cells, and erythrocyte macrocytosis. The disorder results from defective cellular DNA repair. |
| MONDO:0030717 | immunodeficiency 97 with autoinflammation | | An autosomal recessive complex immunologic disorder with variable features. Affected individuals present in the first decade of life with inflammatory interstitial lung disease or colitis due to abnormal tissue infiltration by activated T cells. Patients develop autoimmune cytopenias and may have lymphadenopathy; 1 reported patient had features of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Some patients may have recurrent infections associated with mild lymphopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, and NK cell dysfunction. Immunologic workup indicates signs of significant immune dysregulation with elevation of inflammatory serum markers, variable immune cell defects involving neutrophils, NK cells, and myeloid cells, and disrupted levels of T regulatory cells (Tregs). Two unrelated patients have been reported. |
| MONDO:0030798 | immunodeficiency 99 with hypogammaglobulinemia and autoimmune cytopenias | | An autosomal recessive immunologic disorder characterized by the onset of recurrent sinopulmonary infections in early childhood. Laboratory studies reveal hypogammaglobulinemia with decreased memory B cells that show impaired class-switch recombination (CSR) and decreased somatic hypermutation (SHM). Due to abnormal antibody production and impaired self-tolerance, patients may develop autoimmune cytopenias, such as thrombocytopenia, or autoimmune features, such as vitiligo. There are also defects in the T-cell compartment. |
| MONDO:0030898 | immunodeficiency 76 | | An autosomal recessive primary immunologic disorder characterized by onset of recurrent bacterial, viral, and fungal infections in early childhood. Laboratory studies show T-cell lymphopenia and may show variable B-cell or immunoglobulin abnormalities. More variable features found in some patients include lymphoma and neurologic features. Although bone marrow transplantation may be curative, many patients die in childhood. |

The disease presents a chronic relapsing course and systemic features (e.g. fever, malaise, arthralgia, myalgia) may be associated. |
| MONDO:0035236 | pustular pyoderma gangrenosum | A rare subtype of pyoderma gangrenosum characterized by multiple painful, sterile pustules with a surrounding erythematous halo, predominantly occurring on the trunk and extensor surfaces of the limbs, and potentially persisting for months. Histopathology shows a dermal neutrophilic infiltrate and subcorneal neutrophilic micropustules. The condition is commonly associated with inflammatory bowel disease. |
| MONDO:0035237 | bullous pyoderma gangrenosum | A rare subtype of pyoderma gangrenosum disease characterized by grouped vesicles that rapidly spread and coalesce to form large bullae, which evolve into ulcerations that have an erythematous peripheral halo and central necrosis, mainly affecting the upper limbs and face. Lymphoproliferative diseases are frequently associated, thus prognosis is often compromised. |
| MONDO:0035238 | vegetative pyoderma gangrenosum | A rare subtype of pyoderma gangrenosum disease characterized by a solitary, erythematous, ulcerated plaque, which lacks the violaceous border typically present in classic pyoderma gangrenosum, usually affecting individuals who are otherwise healthy. Histologically, the lesion presents a central layer containing neutrophilic inflamation, surrounded by a palisade of histiocytes, which are rimmed by a lymphocytic infiltrate. In comparison with the other variants of pyoderma gangrenosum, this subtype usually shows a good response to less aggressive treatments and underlying systemic disorders are less frequently associated. It is considered the most benign and uncommon clinical variant of pyoderma gangrenosum. |
| MONDO:0035249 | obsolete anomalous aortic origin of the left coronary artery | OBSOLETE. A rare coronary artery congenital malformation characterized by an anomalous origin and course of the left coronary artery, which originates from the right aortic sinus of Valsalva and has an abnormal proximal course, which may be intramural, prepulmonic, subpulmonic, retroaortic, retrocardiac or wrapped around the apex. Patients are frequently asymptomatic, although chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, dizziness, syncope, and sudden cardiac arrest/death (typically following intense physical exertion) may be observed. This malformation is associated with a high risk of sudden cardiac death so surgical revascularization is recommended even in cases with no associated evidence of myocardial ischemia. [Orphanet:541443] |
| MONDO:0035250 | obsolete anomalous aortic origin of the right coronary artery | OBSOLETE. A rare coronary artery congenital malformation characterized by an anomalous origin and course of the right coronary artery, which originates from the left aortic sinus of Valsalva and has an abnormal proximal course, which may be intramural, prepulmonic, subpulmonic, retroaortic, retrocardiac or wrapped around the apex. Patients are frequently asymptomatic, although chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, dizziness, syncope, and sudden cardiac arrest/death (typically following intense physical exertion) may be observed. This malformation is associated with a lower risk of sudden cardiac death therefore surgical revascularization is recommended only when signs and/or symptoms of ischemia are present. [Orphanet:541454] |
| MONDO:0035251 | obsolete anomalous aortic origin of coronary artery | OBSOLETE. A rare group of coronary artery congenital malformation disorders characterized by an anomalous origin and course of the left or right coronary artery, which originates from the contralateral aortic sinus of Valsalva and has an anomalous trajectory which may be: pre-pulmonary (with no hemodynamic consequences), retroaortic (with a course posterior to the aortic root and no hemodynamic consequences), interarterial (located between the aorta and the pulmonary artery and associated with a poorer prognosis), subpulmonary (with an intraconal or intraseptal course), or retrocardiac (located in the posterior atrioventricular sulcus). Clinical manifestations depend on the specific anomalous origin and course which is present, with patients being frequently asymptomatic, although nonspecific chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, dyspnea or syncope, usually following physical exertion, may be associated. Sudden death, due to compression/occlusion of the coronary artery and usually associated with, or immediately following, vigorous physical exercise, may be occasionally observed. [Orphanet:541478] |
| MONDO:0035252 | obsolete anomalous origin of coronary artery from the pulmonary artery | OBSOLETE. A rare coronary artery congenital malformation characterized by an anomalous origin of the left (ALCAPA) or right (ARCAPA) coronary artery from the pulmonary artery, with variable clinical presentation, ranging from asymptomatic to early heart failure and death depending on the degree of development of collateral circulation between the left and right coronary artery systems, as well as the pressure level of the pulmonary artery. Infants typically present with feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, dyspnea, irritability, hyperhidrosis, heart murmurs, tachypnea, tachycardia and/or chest pain while adults usually associate dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, and intolerance to physical exercise. Sudden death may occur due to congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, valvular insufficiencies or ventricular arrhythmias.

| MONDO:0100491 | generalized pustular psoriasis | A rare and extreme form of psoriasis characterized by the appearance of sterile pustules which can take many patterns. All the main pathological features of the disease are accentuated. Generalized pustular psoriasis is clinically heterogeneous in its age at onset, precipitants, severity, and natural history. Many overlapping clinical entities are recognized. There is a relationship between these entities and plaque psoriasis, as some individuals may have episodes of plaque psoriasis preceding or following the generalized pustular psoriasis, but in others generalized pustular psoriasis occurs as the sole phenotype without plaque psoriasis at any time. |
| MONDO:0700043 | syndrome caused by partial chromosomal duplication of the short arm of chromosome 9 | |
| MONDO:8000023 | type 3 autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome | A rare, primary immunodeficiency. It is caused by a currently undetermined defect in the Fas-induced apoptosis pathway. No mutations in Fas, FASLG or CASP10 are detectable. Disruption of Fas-induced apoptosis impairs lymphocyte homeostasis and immune tolerance. Characteristic laboratory findings include an increase in circulating, double-negative (CD4-/CD8-) T cells in the setting of immune-mediated anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Clinical signs present in childhood include fatigue, pallor, bruising, hepatosplenomegaly and chronic, non-malignant, non-infectious lymphadenopathy. The clinical course is influenced by a strong association with other autoimmune disorders and an increased risk for developing Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. |
| MONDO:8000024 | autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, type III caused by mutation in PRKCD | Any autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the PRKCD gene. |

At birth, the hands and feet may appear abnormally short and broad. Over time, the apparent disproportion becomes even more obvious, especially during the first years of life. Additional features may include: limited extension of the elbows and arms; progressive abnormal curvature of the spine; an enlarged head; and a slightly flattened midface. Acromesomelic dysplasia is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. There are different types of acromesomelic dysplasia, which are distinguished by their genetic cause.

Currently, the preferred term for both conditions is “ anti-GBM antibody disease ”. Circulating antibodies are directed against the collagen of the part of the kidney known as the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), resulting in acute or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Antibodies also attack the collagen of the air sacs of the lung (alveoli) resulting in bleeding of the lung (pulmonary hemorrhage). Symptoms may include general body discomfort or pain, bleeding from the nose and/or blood in the urine, respiratory problems, anemia, chest pain, and kidney failure. Anti-GBM disease is thought to result from an environmental insult (smoking, infections, exposure to certain drugs) in a person with genetic susceptibility, such as a specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type. Diagnosis is confirmed with the presence of anti-GBM antibody in the blood or in the kidney. The treatment of choice is plasmapheresis in conjunction with prednisone and cyclophosphamide. | An autoimmune disease that affects the lungs and kidneys and is characterized by pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage (bleeding in the lungs) and a kidney disease known as glomerulonephritis.

# 2017-11-10 1.0 Release

This is the first release of MONDO with MONDO IDs as primary.

The core ontology is available in 3 formats:

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo.obo : obo format, use xrefs for equivalence to externals
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo.owl : owl format, use equivalence axioms to externals
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo.json : json format, use equivalence axioms to externals

Downloads are also available from https://osf.io/2qk53/files/ but it is recommended you use the purls

All IDs in Orphanet, OMIM, EFO and DOID can be *precisely* mapped
forward using either equivalence axioms (OWL version) or via xrefs
(OBO Format version). Note that for these ID spaces, only precise 1-1
xrefs are included in the release file.

Mapping files for particular subsets available on request.

In the release following this one, NCIT and GARD will join this
precise set.

### Legacy Support

An alternate version of this version of MONDO that retains external
IDs and primary IDs is available in the extid/ folder on OSF, or via
purls

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo/extid/mondo.obo
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo/extid/mondo.owl
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo/extid/mondo.json

Note this support will not be maintained in perpetuity. You are
recommended to use the main MONDO release.

# 2017-10-18 Pre-release

First release using new pipeline. kboom was used to combine orphanet,
efo, omim and doid. Note ncit is slated for future incorporation.

The resulting ontology was merged using most probably equivalence
axioms. MONDO IDs assigned as clique leaders. Source xrefs were
retained, but these xrefs were annotated with kboom interpretations
(see editors guide for details).

The kboom report was used to examine dubious merge groupings, these
were then manually addressed. Some issues were filed on the old
tracker: https://github.com/monarch-initiative/monarch-disease-ontology/issues

Additional axiomatization was added for straightforward high level
grouping classes.

For the release, we map back to original clique leaders. We also make
a 'pre' release consisting of classes with MONDO IDs as primary. See
obo page for more details:

http://obofoundry.org/ontology/mondo.html

## 2017-10-02

Merging of multiple equivalent classes

## 2017-09-24

Initial version of mondo created by running kboom using as input:

* Efo-disease
* Omim, diseases
* Orphanet/ORDO, after initial pre-processing
* DC

Note NCIT was explicitly excluded as it complicates the results due to large differences in how EFO/DO deal with cancer vs NCIT (see later). We also removed MESH due to low quality (but of course we retain xrefs to MESH, we simply did not input its structure into kboom)

and merging the results, the following parameters used:

```
PRIORITIES_ID := -s OMIM 10 -s EFO 8 -s DOID 6 -s Orphanet 7 -s MESH 4
PRIORITIES_LABEL :=  -l DOID 10 -l EFO 11 -l NCIT 8 -l Orphanet 5  -l OMIM 3 -l MESH 1
PRIORITIES_DEF := -d Orphanet 10 -d NCIT 8 -l EFO 11 -d DOID 5  -d MESH 3 -d OMIM 1
```

The resulting ontology had new IDs minted. The clique leader was retained with a MONDO:Leader annotation. The kboom xref interpretations also retained as annotations.

We were conservative with automatic merging. Post kboom we used ontobio to determine classes that were likely candidates for merging. These were then manually merged, and any reasoner errors investigated.

Many of these were cancer-related. A common pattern was DO or EFO classifying “X cancer” under “Y carcinoma” (where X isa/part of Y). This is common because the typical form of many cancers is a carcinoma, but this causes issues if “X cancer” has sarcomas as children. These were resolved by assuming “X cancer” can be generic, unless it is to a very specific tissue type that is entirely epithelial for example.

Note we will likely return to cancers later and swap in NCIT. It is too hard to do this as an initial step.

I also merged in a lot of the historic DCs. These were originally used for grouping OMIMs. Many were previously merged into DO/EFO/Orphanet. However, some were retained. These were manually merged based on obvious lexical and graph properties. Some remain.
