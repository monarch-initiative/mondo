The disease presents a chronic relapsing course and systemic features (e.g. fever, malaise, arthralgia, myalgia) may be associated. |
| MONDO:0035236 | pustular pyoderma gangrenosum | A rare subtype of pyoderma gangrenosum characterized by multiple painful, sterile pustules with a surrounding erythematous halo, predominantly occurring on the trunk and extensor surfaces of the limbs, and potentially persisting for months. Histopathology shows a dermal neutrophilic infiltrate and subcorneal neutrophilic micropustules. The condition is commonly associated with inflammatory bowel disease. |
| MONDO:0035237 | bullous pyoderma gangrenosum | A rare subtype of pyoderma gangrenosum disease characterized by grouped vesicles that rapidly spread and coalesce to form large bullae, which evolve into ulcerations that have an erythematous peripheral halo and central necrosis, mainly affecting the upper limbs and face. Lymphoproliferative diseases are frequently associated, thus prognosis is often compromised. |
| MONDO:0035238 | vegetative pyoderma gangrenosum | A rare subtype of pyoderma gangrenosum disease characterized by a solitary, erythematous, ulcerated plaque, which lacks the violaceous border typically present in classic pyoderma gangrenosum, usually affecting individuals who are otherwise healthy. Histologically, the lesion presents a central layer containing neutrophilic inflamation, surrounded by a palisade of histiocytes, which are rimmed by a lymphocytic infiltrate. In comparison with the other variants of pyoderma gangrenosum, this subtype usually shows a good response to less aggressive treatments and underlying systemic disorders are less frequently associated. It is considered the most benign and uncommon clinical variant of pyoderma gangrenosum. |
| MONDO:0035249 | obsolete anomalous aortic origin of the left coronary artery | OBSOLETE. A rare coronary artery congenital malformation characterized by an anomalous origin and course of the left coronary artery, which originates from the right aortic sinus of Valsalva and has an abnormal proximal course, which may be intramural, prepulmonic, subpulmonic, retroaortic, retrocardiac or wrapped around the apex. Patients are frequently asymptomatic, although chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, dizziness, syncope, and sudden cardiac arrest/death (typically following intense physical exertion) may be observed. This malformation is associated with a high risk of sudden cardiac death so surgical revascularization is recommended even in cases with no associated evidence of myocardial ischemia. [Orphanet:541443] |
| MONDO:0035250 | obsolete anomalous aortic origin of the right coronary artery | OBSOLETE. A rare coronary artery congenital malformation characterized by an anomalous origin and course of the right coronary artery, which originates from the left aortic sinus of Valsalva and has an abnormal proximal course, which may be intramural, prepulmonic, subpulmonic, retroaortic, retrocardiac or wrapped around the apex. Patients are frequently asymptomatic, although chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, dizziness, syncope, and sudden cardiac arrest/death (typically following intense physical exertion) may be observed. This malformation is associated with a lower risk of sudden cardiac death therefore surgical revascularization is recommended only when signs and/or symptoms of ischemia are present. [Orphanet:541454] |
| MONDO:0035251 | obsolete anomalous aortic origin of coronary artery | OBSOLETE. A rare group of coronary artery congenital malformation disorders characterized by an anomalous origin and course of the left or right coronary artery, which originates from the contralateral aortic sinus of Valsalva and has an anomalous trajectory which may be: pre-pulmonary (with no hemodynamic consequences), retroaortic (with a course posterior to the aortic root and no hemodynamic consequences), interarterial (located between the aorta and the pulmonary artery and associated with a poorer prognosis), subpulmonary (with an intraconal or intraseptal course), or retrocardiac (located in the posterior atrioventricular sulcus). Clinical manifestations depend on the specific anomalous origin and course which is present, with patients being frequently asymptomatic, although nonspecific chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, dyspnea or syncope, usually following physical exertion, may be associated. Sudden death, due to compression/occlusion of the coronary artery and usually associated with, or immediately following, vigorous physical exercise, may be occasionally observed. [Orphanet:541478] |
| MONDO:0035252 | obsolete anomalous origin of coronary artery from the pulmonary artery | OBSOLETE. A rare coronary artery congenital malformation characterized by an anomalous origin of the left (ALCAPA) or right (ARCAPA) coronary artery from the pulmonary artery, with variable clinical presentation, ranging from asymptomatic to early heart failure and death depending on the degree of development of collateral circulation between the left and right coronary artery systems, as well as the pressure level of the pulmonary artery. Infants typically present with feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, dyspnea, irritability, hyperhidrosis, heart murmurs, tachypnea, tachycardia and/or chest pain while adults usually associate dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, and intolerance to physical exercise. Sudden death may occur due to congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, valvular insufficiencies or ventricular arrhythmias. The majority of cases reported are of an ALCAPA, while ARCAPA is rarely observed. [Orphanet:541507] |
| MONDO:0035267 | obsolete quadricuspid aortic valve | OBSOLETE. A rare congenital aortic malformation characterized by an aortic valve with four cusps instead of the usual three. The cusps can be equal-sized or vary in size. The malformation is an isolated finding in the majority of cases but may also be associated with other cardiac anomalies. The most common complication is aortic regurgitation. Aortic stenosis is infrequently observed. Patients usually become symptomatic in the fifth to sixth decade of life and may present with palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue, pedal edema, and syncope. In severe cases, congestive heart failure can be the presenting symptom. [Orphanet:542568] |
| MONDO:0035274 | obsolete anomaly of the coronary ostia | OBSOLETE. A group of rare congenital coronary artery malformations comprising abnormal number of coronary ostia, malposition of a coronary ostium, and stenosis or atresia of a coronary ostium.

| MONDO:0100491 | generalized pustular psoriasis | A rare and extreme form of psoriasis characterized by the appearance of sterile pustules which can take many patterns. All the main pathological features of the disease are accentuated. Generalized pustular psoriasis is clinically heterogeneous in its age at onset, precipitants, severity, and natural history. Many overlapping clinical entities are recognized. There is a relationship between these entities and plaque psoriasis, as some individuals may have episodes of plaque psoriasis preceding or following the generalized pustular psoriasis, but in others generalized pustular psoriasis occurs as the sole phenotype without plaque psoriasis at any time. |
| MONDO:0700043 | syndrome caused by partial chromosomal duplication of the short arm of chromosome 9 | |
| MONDO:8000023 | type 3 autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome | A rare, primary immunodeficiency. It is caused by a currently undetermined defect in the Fas-induced apoptosis pathway.

| MONDO:0019696 | acromesomelic dysplasia | Acromesomelic dysplasia describes a group of extremely rare, inherited, progressive skeletal conditions that result in a particular form of short stature, called short-limb dwarfism. The short stature is the result of unusually short forearms and forelegs (mesomelia) and abnormal shortening of the bones in the hands and feet (acromelia). At birth, the hands and feet may appear abnormally short and broad. Over time, the apparent disproportion becomes even more obvious, especially during the first years of life. Additional features may include: limited extension of the elbows and arms; progressive abnormal curvature of the spine; an enlarged head; and a slightly flattened midface. Acromesomelic dysplasia is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. There are different types of acromesomelic dysplasia, which are distinguished by their genetic cause.

| MONDO:0019155 | Leydig cell hypoplasia | Leydig cell hypoplasia (LCH) is a condition in males that affects sexual development. It is characterized by underdevelopment of the Leydig cells, which are cells in the testes that secrete male sex hormones (androgens) and are important for male sexual development. Individuals with LCH have a typical male genetic make-up (46, XY), but due to lowered levels of androgens, may have a range of genital (reproductive organ) differences. Individuals with LCH may have a small penis (micropenis),the opening of the urethra may be located on the underside of the penis (hypospadias), or the scrotum may be divided into two halves (bifid scrotum). Given these differences in development, the external genitalia may not appear clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia). Some individuals with LCH can have female external genitalia and small testes that have not descended and are located in the pelvis, abdomen, or groin. This may be referred to as type 1, whereas less severe cases might be called type 2. LCH is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by mutations in the LHCGR gene.Although there is no specific treatment or cure for LCH, there may be ways to manage the symptoms. A team of doctors or specialists is often needed to figure out the treatment options for each person. | A condition in males that affects sexual development.

Individuals with LCH may have a small penis (micropenis),the opening of the urethra may be located on the underside of the penis (hypospadias), or the scrotum may be divided into two halves (bifid scrotum). Given these differences in development, the external genitalia may not appear clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia). Some individuals with LCH can have female external genitalia and small testes that have not descended and are located in the pelvis, abdomen, or groin. This may be referred to as type 1, whereas less severe cases might be called type 2. LCH is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by mutations in the LHCGR gene.Although there is no specific treatment or cure for LCH, there may be ways to manage the symptoms. A team of doctors or specialists is often needed to figure out the treatment options for each person. |

Currently, the preferred term for both conditions is “ anti-GBM antibody disease ”. Circulating antibodies are directed against the collagen of the part of the kidney known as the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), resulting in acute or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Antibodies also attack the collagen of the air sacs of the lung (alveoli) resulting in bleeding of the lung (pulmonary hemorrhage). Symptoms may include general body discomfort or pain, bleeding from the nose and/or blood in the urine, respiratory problems, anemia, chest pain, and kidney failure. Anti-GBM disease is thought to result from an environmental insult (smoking, infections, exposure to certain drugs) in a person with genetic susceptibility, such as a specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type. Diagnosis is confirmed with the presence of anti-GBM antibody in the blood or in the kidney. The treatment of choice is plasmapheresis in conjunction with prednisone and cyclophosphamide. | An autoimmune disease that affects the lungs and kidneys and is characterized by pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage (bleeding in the lungs) and a kidney disease known as glomerulonephritis.

# 2017-11-10 1.0 Release

This is the first release of MONDO with MONDO IDs as primary.

The core ontology is available in 3 formats:

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo.obo : obo format, use xrefs for equivalence to externals
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo.owl : owl format, use equivalence axioms to externals
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo.json : json format, use equivalence axioms to externals

Downloads are also available from https://osf.io/2qk53/files/ but it is recommended you use the purls

All IDs in Orphanet, OMIM, EFO and DOID can be *precisely* mapped
forward using either equivalence axioms (OWL version) or via xrefs
(OBO Format version). Note that for these ID spaces, only precise 1-1
xrefs are included in the release file.

Mapping files for particular subsets available on request.

In the release following this one, NCIT and GARD will join this
precise set.

### Legacy Support

An alternate version of this version of MONDO that retains external
IDs and primary IDs is available in the extid/ folder on OSF, or via
purls

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo/extid/mondo.obo
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo/extid/mondo.owl
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo/extid/mondo.json

Note this support will not be maintained in perpetuity. You are
recommended to use the main MONDO release.

# 2017-10-18 Pre-release

First release using new pipeline. kboom was used to combine orphanet,
efo, omim and doid. Note ncit is slated for future incorporation.

The resulting ontology was merged using most probably equivalence
axioms. MONDO IDs assigned as clique leaders. Source xrefs were
retained, but these xrefs were annotated with kboom interpretations
(see editors guide for details).

The kboom report was used to examine dubious merge groupings, these
were then manually addressed. Some issues were filed on the old
tracker: https://github.com/monarch-initiative/monarch-disease-ontology/issues

Additional axiomatization was added for straightforward high level
grouping classes.

For the release, we map back to original clique leaders. We also make
a 'pre' release consisting of classes with MONDO IDs as primary. See
obo page for more details:

Merging of multiple equivalent classes

## 2017-09-24

Initial version of mondo created by running kboom using as input:

* Efo-disease
* Omim, diseases
* Orphanet/ORDO, after initial pre-processing
* DC

Note NCIT was explicitly excluded as it complicates the results due to large differences in how EFO/DO deal with cancer vs NCIT (see later). We also removed MESH due to low quality (but of course we retain xrefs to MESH, we simply did not input its structure into kboom)

and merging the results, the following parameters used:

```
PRIORITIES_ID := -s OMIM 10 -s EFO 8 -s DOID 6 -s Orphanet 7 -s MESH 4
PRIORITIES_LABEL :=  -l DOID 10 -l EFO 11 -l NCIT 8 -l Orphanet 5  -l OMIM 3 -l MESH 1
PRIORITIES_DEF := -d Orphanet 10 -d NCIT 8 -l EFO 11 -d DOID 5  -d MESH 3 -d OMIM 1
```

The resulting ontology had new IDs minted. The clique leader was retained with a MONDO:Leader annotation. The kboom xref interpretations also retained as annotations.

We were conservative with automatic merging. Post kboom we used ontobio to determine classes that were likely candidates for merging. These were then manually merged, and any reasoner errors investigated.

Many of these were cancer-related. A common pattern was DO or EFO classifying “X cancer” under “Y carcinoma” (where X isa/part of Y). This is common because the typical form of many cancers is a carcinoma, but this causes issues if “X cancer” has sarcomas as children. These were resolved by assuming “X cancer” can be generic, unless it is to a very specific tissue type that is entirely epithelial for example.

Note we will likely return to cancers later and swap in NCIT. It is too hard to do this as an initial step.

I also merged in a lot of the historic DCs. These were originally used for grouping OMIMs. Many were previously merged into DO/EFO/Orphanet. However, some were retained. These were manually merged based on obvious lexical and graph properties. Some remain.
