## Note: Subtypes (is_a) vs Complications (disease_arises_from_feature)

The tree above uses two different relationship types, shown by different indentation markers:

- `>>` = **is_a** (true subtype): The child IS a form of the parent.
  - CF-gastritis syndrome IS a form of cystic fibrosis (patients meet full CF diagnostic criteria plus additional features).
  - CBAVD from CFTR IS a form of CFTR-related disorder (single-organ CFTR dysfunction not meeting CF criteria).

- `──` = **disease_arises_from_feature** (complication): The condition arises as a consequence of the parent but is NOT a subtype of it.
  - CFRD is NOT a form of cystic fibrosis — it is a form of **diabetes mellitus** that arises as a complication of CF.
  - CFLD is NOT a form of cystic fibrosis — it is a form of **liver disorder** that arises as a complication of CF.

### Why the distinction matters

In the ontology, `is_a` means "is a subtype of." Saying CFRD `is_a` CF would mean "cystic fibrosis-related diabetes is a form of cystic fibrosis," which is clinically incorrect. CFRD is a form of diabetes that occurs in CF patients. Similarly, CFLD is a form of liver disease, not a form of CF.

The `disease_arises_from_feature` relationship (RO:0004022) correctly captures the causal link without asserting subtype status. In the reasoner:

| Term | Primary parent (is_a) | Relationship to CF |
|------|----------------------|-------------------|
| CF-gastritis syndrome | cystic fibrosis | is_a (subtype) |
| CFRD | diabetes mellitus | disease_arises_from_feature (complication) |
| CFLD | liver disorder | disease_arises_from_feature (complication) |
| CBAVD from CFTR | CFTR-related disorder | is_a (subtype) |
